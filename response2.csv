search_categories_general,"Bags are packed and not sure where to go? If guests need inspiration, they can browse Airbnb Categories—collections based on a stay’s unique style, location, or proximity to an activity—to help them find the stay (and style) that’s right for them. Guests can discover more flexible ways to travel—browsing millions of homes they never knew existed. If a guest searches for a specific destination, their search results will include all listings. In addition, Categories will be displayed, making it even easier to discover incredible homes within (or just beyond) their search area."
search_cancellation_policy,"Even the best-laid plans can change. Airbnb Hosts get that, which is why many of them offer plenty of time to cancel your reservation penalty-free if something comes up.

Now you can find listings with more flexible cancellation policies by using our search filter. You can search for listings that offer a full refund if you end up needing to cancel, even if it’s close to your departure date.

To use this filter, simply enter your destination and travel dates. On the listings page you can select the cancellation filter to show only listings that offer:

A full refund of nightly rate if you cancel at least 1 day prior to arrival, or,
A full refund of nightly rate if you cancel at least 5 days prior to arrival
You can see the specific cancellation policy your Host has set on their listing before you book which will tell you what date you need to cancel by to avoid any penalties."

If they don’t search for a specific destination, a selection of Categories may appear depending on seasons, location, and any previous guest searches."
search_split ,"Want to split longer stays between two different homes?

Guests can try using Split Stays—a feature that pairs two consecutive stays for the span of their dates, allowing them to explore different homes, neighborhoods, or even different destinations, during their trip.

For example, if they’re browsing the Surfing category, Split Stays may show them a pair of homes in Santa Barbara and La Jolla, and then display the distance between both stays on a map so they’ll know where both homes are (and which stay is first). Once they select a Split Stay, they’re guided through an easy-to-use interface to book each stay—one home at a time."
search_neighbourhood,"You can search for a specific neighborhood, landmark, or street the same way you would for a city—by typing it into the Location field.

listing_availability,"As long as you enter your destination, travel dates, and number of guests when searching on Airbnb, all listings that appear should be available.

You can also consider messaging the Host to confirm availability, along with any other details. We encourage Hosts to keep their calendars up to date, but it doesn’t hurt to check."
listing_type,"Entire place
Entire places are best if you're seeking a home away from home. With an entire place, you'll have the whole space to yourself. This usually includes a bedroom, a bathroom, a kitchen, and a separate, dedicated entrance. Hosts should note in the description if they'll be on the property or not (ex: ""Host occupies first floor of the home""), and provide further details on the listing.

Private rooms
Private rooms are great when you prefer a little privacy, yet still value a local connection. When you book a private room, you'll have your own private room for sleeping and may share some spaces with others. You might need to walk through indoor spaces that another host or guest may occupy to get to your room.

Hotel rooms
Whether private or shared, hotel rooms provide a level of service and hospitality associated with traditional hotels. The rooms are available in boutique or lifestyle hotels, hostels, bed and breakfasts, or similar properties. They typically include vibrant common areas and rooms with unique touches.

Shared rooms
Shared rooms are for when you don't mind sharing a space with others. When you book a shared room, you'll be sleeping in a space that is shared with others and share the entire space with other people. Shared rooms are popular among flexible travelers looking for new friends and budget-friendly stays."
listing_selfcheck,"Self check-in means guests can access a place without needing the Host to be there. Any time after their designated check-in time on their arrival date, guests can conveniently gain access via:

WEEKEND TRIP: reviews of weekend stays that started on a Friday or Saturday and ended on a Sunday
LAST MINUTE TRIP: any stays booked less than 2 days in advance

Guests staying for 28 days or longer are able to pay for their stay on a monthly basis."
listing_nonrefund,"A non-refundable option is a discount that lets you book at a lower price but can’t be canceled for a full refund unless you have an extenuating circumstance. Hosts can offer it on top of other discounts like monthly or weekly discounts.

1 day before desired check-in for Flexible cancellation listings
5 days before desired check-in for Moderate cancellation listings
14 days before desired check-in for Strict cancellation listings"
listing_license,"Some cities require Hosts to obtain a license or registration number to list their places on Airbnb. The corresponding field on their listing allows them to show that number for compliance. 

Not every city requires this, so the absence of a registration number does not mean the Host is not compliant—they’re just not required to register. 

Instead of number, you might find another message in that field:  

City registration pending: The Host has started the registration process but hasn’t been granted a license or registration number yet—it’s totally fine to book these listings 
Exempt: The listing is exempt from registration for reasons determined by the city—these listings are also perfectly fine to book "

If they can’t, you have 72 hours from when you first discover the problem to contact us and we’ll look into it.

If you can’t get into your listing, and your Host can’t help you get in
If the Host, another person, or a pet is in the space during your stay, and it wasn’t mentioned in the listing description
If the listing is uninhabitable at check-in because of cleanliness, safety, or health reasons

book_emergency,"In some instances following a crisis event, Airbnb.org activates a program which allows people who have been impacted to request emergency housing directly. In these instances, you’ll find an article in Airbnb’s Press Room with information about the event and a link where you can submit a request.

You’ll need to log into or create an Airbnb account, confirm your eligibility address, answer a few questions, and agree to certain terms.

After you submit your request, Airbnb.org may get in touch to check on additional details. Airbnb.org aims to review all submissions within 24 hours. If your information can’t be verified or it doesn’t meet Airbnb.org’s eligibility criteria, you’ll receive an email to let you know.

In other instances, people must be referred or assisted by an Airbnb.org nonprofit partner or other organization in order to book or utilize a stay. In these instances, it is not possible for individuals to apply for emergency housing directly.

If you’re approved, you'll receive an email inviting you to browse available Airbnb.org stays. Here are a few tips to keep in mind:

Read the email invitation carefully. It’ll outline how to book a stay and the dates for which you can book.
Make sure the place is a good fit. Check the listing details—number of bedrooms, amenities, and photos.
Make sure your stay meets the program requirements. If it doesn’t, it'll be canceled according to the Host's cancellation policy.

Hosts can send pre-approvals to multiple potential guests, so if you’ve found the perfect space, make sure to complete the booking process as soon as possible.

The trip is over, and the Host has 14 days to leave a review for the guest.

Special offer sent
The Host has invited the guest to book the dates shown at a different price from what’s listed. Hosts often do this to offer a discount or add an additional amount, such as a pet fee, to the reservation. The guest has 24 hours to accept by choosing Book Now—at which point, the reservation is automatically accepted.

Trip changed by Airbnb
Our customer support team has changed the trip details on behalf of the Host or guest.

Trip change declined
The Host has declined the guest’s request to change details about their trip.

Trip change requested
The guest has requested to change details about their trip. If the Host doesn't accept, they’ll have to go with the original plan or cancel.

Trip change sent
The Host has requested to change details about their trip. If the guest doesn’t accept, they’ll have to go with the original plan or cancel.

Trip declined
Guest asked a trip question and the Host declined it, which means the guest is not able to send a trip request. This may be due to a change in their availability.

Inquiry
The guest has asked a question about specific dates but hasn't yet sent a trip request. In order to maintain their response rate, we encourage Hosts to write back within 24 hours and invite guests to book, decline, or send a special offer before the inquiry expires. If your status says “Inquiry - expires soon,” check the Today dashboard to find out how many hours you have to respond before it’s too late. Learn more about contacting Hosts."
contact_no_reply,"Most Hosts respond within a few hours, but time zones and lack of internet access might slow things down. In the meantime, try reaching out to other Hosts in the area. Just be careful not to send more than one trip request for the same dates to ensure you don’t end up double booked.

Don’t want to wait for a Host response? Try Instant Book listings—they allow you to book immediately without needing to send a request to the Host for approval, provided you’ve completed your account setup."
contact_when,"Hosts have 24 hours to accept or decline your request, but the vast majority reply within 12 hours. Chances are, it’ll be even quicker: More than half of all trip requests are accepted within one hour of the Host reading it.

You can check the status of your trip request any time you like, but you’ll also receive email updates when things change.

When a Host confirms your request, your payment will be processed and collected in full by Airbnb. If they decline or let it expire, you won’t be charged and you’re free to book a different stay.

Need more info from your Host? You can use your Inbox to message the Host or go to your Trips."
change_pending,"Change of plans? No problem. As long your reservation status is still Pending, you can withdraw your request and send a new one: Just go to your message thread with the Host and select ?Withdraw request, or you can go to Trips and cancel a pending trip request. 

After that, simply send a new request with your updated details. 

After you’ve canceled or withdrawn the request, you can then send a new request with your changed dates or number of guests."
book_experience,"It’s easy to book—just find the Experiences section on the Airbnb website or app. You can choose a specific city and dates, or browse through all experiences. Keep in mind, experience availability is set by the individual Host.

Need a great staycation activity? You don’t need to have a home booked on Airbnb in order to book an experience."
book_mexperience,You can book as many experiences as you can handle! Just cross-check schedules to avoid booking experiences that overlap.
book_oexperience,"You can book an online Experience the same way you'd book an in-person one. Just be sure you can access Zoom via your desktop, tablet, or mobile device."
book_oexperience_price,"Online Experiences are priced per person, and you’ll be asked to book a spot for each person joining the Experience. However, if a Host is open to multiple guests joining per device, they will let you know on their Experience page under What You’ll Do and How to Participate."
book_oexperience_ccrefund,"You can cancel up to 7 days before start time or within 24 hours of booking. And you can change a reservation up to 72 hours before the Experience begins. Cancellations and changes have the same policies for both online and in-person Airbnb Experiences.

You’re eligible for a full refund if there are any technical difficulties, such as audio or video issues, on your own device or the Host’s device during an online Experience."
book_oexperience_attend,"You’ll learn everything you need to know in your confirmation email, but you can also check the How to participate and Guest requirements sections of the Experience page.

book_oexperience_report,"If you come across any inappropriate content, contact Airbnb’s community support and report it. Provide as much information as possible and we’ll investigate the issue."
experience_include,"Every experience is different, so it’s a good idea to carefully review what is and isn’t included before you book.

For instance, you’d need to know if drinks are included in your tasting experience, or if you’ll need to pay for the special exhibit at a museum tour.

Hosts add this info to the experience page. Check the What’s included or What I’ll provide section to find out what to expect.

Accommodations are typically not included with single-day experiences. Multi-day adventures do include lodging, meals, and activities."
experience_group,"When you find the Experience that you want to book, check if the Book for a private group option is available. You can also contact the Host to learn if they can host your group privately or customize the Experience for your group. Just be aware that whether a Host offers private groups is at the Host’s discretion

If your group makes a reservation and the total amount that you’d pay for that reservation exceeds the Host’s minimum price, then your group will pay the higher amount."
experience_inv,"If you book an experience, you can send all the additional guests an invitation link that will prompt them to click or tap Claim Your Seat. Once they do, they’ll have all the benefits of being added to the reservation.

One important thing: The people you invite must have an Airbnb account in order to use the Claim Your Seat feature.

After you’ve completed your booking:

Go to Trips and find your experience under the Upcoming tab
Click or tap More details
Scroll down to Copy invite link
Send the link to people in your group
Once they click or tap Claim Your Seat, your guests will get:

A confirmation email with their reservation details and a Zoom link to sign into the event. (Don’t worry! The email won’t display pricing information, that’s between you and the Host).
Access to a direct message thread with the Host, as well as a group message thread with the other attendees (including you as the booker).
The option to leave a review after the experience is over.
If you need to increase the group size (the more, the merrier!), you’ll always have the option to add more guests before the experience begins under Manage Reservation—depending on what your experience host can accommodate."

experience_requirements,"Special certification
Curious if your activity requires a specific license, such as scuba certification or a driver’s license? Your Host will provide that info in the guest requirements section of the listing.

Skill level
Some activities require different skill levels, such as a strenuous hike or a sailing adventure. This information should be included in the listing. And, of course, feel free to ask your Host questions about what you should expect during the Experience."
experience_extrappl,"It’s a big “Nope” to bring a couple of extra friends unannounced on the day of an experience. The Host can turn them away if they haven’t booked their spot through Airbnb. 

To avoid disappointment, include your friends in your plans early or have them book the experience by themselves."
experience_buybehalf,"Airbnb Experiences are amazing when they are shared. You can book and pay for up to 10 guests, but you must be one of the participants.

For some Experiences, you may be notified by email that you and any guests you invite need to have an Airbnb account and?provide ID before they can attend."
experience_children,"Hosts should have detailed experience descriptions that specify if the experience is suitable for children or how old children must be to attend.

You can always contact the Host before you book to ask questions about the skill level needed for the experience. And remember, all children or guests under 18 years old must be accompanied by their legal guardian."
experience_diet,"Hosts can often find ways to accommodate a variety of dietary restrictions, so everyone gets to enjoy the experience.

Let your Host know about any dietary restrictions or preferences you or your co-travelers have before you book. You can always message your Host before submitting your reservation request to ask questions.
Make it clear if you have an allergy or dietary restrictions—don’t simply ask your Host if certain ingredients are used or assume the online menu will list all the ingredients. It’s very important that your Host be aware of any allergies or dietary restrictions that your party may have, as it could affect other stages of the experience, such as food preparation and serving. Learn more about how to handle food allergies when attending an Airbnb Experience.
Remind your Host when you arrive for the experience about your dietary restrictions or preferences."

Airbnb.org often works with nonprofit organizations and resettlement agencies specializing in crisis response and refugee resettlement to facilitate on-the-ground support, including assessing the needs and eligibility of potential guests.

Airbnb.org guests booking temporary accommodations on their own are required to set up an Airbnb account, which may include identity verification checks.

A guest’s eligibility may be reviewed by Airbnb.org, its nonprofit partners, referral organizations, or its service providers before they can utilize stays."
emergencybook_frontline,"It isn't possible to apply for a Frontline stay as an individual at this time. To be approved for a Frontline stay, you must be referred by a partner organization.


If you’re approved, a booker from your organization might book on your behalf, or might send you an email invitation to book. Here are a few tips to keep in mind:

Read all of the information in the email invitation. It will tell you more about what kind of stay you can book.
Make sure to book a listing that’s labeled as a “Frontline stay.”
Don’t make a reservation until you receive an invitation to book to ensure discounts are properly applied and you're booking a place for COVID-19 responders. We're unable to waive fees on stays booked outside of the Frontline stays program."
emergencybook_frontlineterms,"To be eligible for a Frontline stay on Airbnb, you should be actively doing COVID-19 support work in the following fields:

First responder (ex: paramedic, police, firefighter)
Medical professional (ex: doctor, physician, nurse, emergency medical technician/EMT, nurse’s aide, respiratory therapist, pharmacist, radiologist, x-ray technician)
Civil protection (ex: social worker)
Community health worker (ex: counselors, non-credentialed community health workers)
You should also be working in one of the following facility types while actively responding to COVID-19:

Hospitals
Temporary hospitals and COVID-19 testing centers
Clinics and urgent care centers
Skilled nursing facilities and nursing homes
Your Frontline stay also needs to be for one of the following reasons:

You prefer to self-isolate (concerns about transmission to family or roommates)
You commute to work and are working extended hours and need to be closer to an approved facility
You’re an out-of-region worker on a temporary assignment
The following reasons are not supported for Frontline stays:

You’re symptomatic and need to self-isolate
You need to quarantine for 14+ days
You need a respite/vacation stay 
You want to permanently relocate"
emergencybook_frontlineextra,"For the most part, frontline stays are for people actively involved in COVID-19 support work and who need to isolate themselves. There are, however, a few exceptions. Other people can stay with you if they are:

Fellow first responders who want to share a place to stay
Family members who had been living with you but no longer have housing because of your work as a first responder"
message_how,"It all starts with a message, whether you have a question about a listing or want to book a stay right away. Getting in touch with a Host starts a message thread you can always go back to, and once you’ve taken that first step, your inbox helps you keep all your communication organized for all your trips. Just go to your Inbox and click on a message thread to read an existing message or send a new one. 

The fine print: You do have to be logged in to your Airbnb account to read or send messages, and you can only send 25 messages within any 24-hour period (we don’t think you’ll need to send any more than that). "

Next, select a card design. To change the language of the card that your host will receive, tap or click the language selector. A check is shown next to the language in which the host will receive the card. The host's preferred language will also be indicated.

Finally, you'll have the option to include a financial contribution where 100% of your payment goes directly to the host.
You’ll be able to preview your card before sending it. Please note that your card and the message inside may be visible to others
After you send your card, you’ll receive a confirmation email including a copy of the card. If your payment method fails, you'll also receive an email letting you know you'll need to update your payment information in order for your contribution to be completed. Once you send a card to a host, you won't be able to send them an additional card.

You may not have the option to add a financial contribution to every card. Some hosts may not be able to accept financial contributions for various reasons, including living in locations where local regulations prevent them from accepting contributions. Also for group stays or experiences, only the guest who paid through Airbnb will be able to make a contribution to that host.

It’s your responsibility to determine whether your contribution is eligible for a tax deduction or credit."

reserve_pending,"Here are some reasons why your reservation might have a ""Pending"" status:
When you make a request to book and complete your payment, a reservation request is automatically sent to the host, who has 24 hours to accept or decline the request. The status for your reservation will be ""Pending"" until the host responds. During this time, you can also contact the host to approve your request. 

If the host declines your request or doesn't respond within 24 hours, the booking status will be updated as ""Declined"" or ""Expired,"" and your payment will be refunded to your original payment method.
Sometimes a reservation will be ""Pending"" if you've booked a place to stay but you haven't completed the identity verification process. In this case, you'll have 12 hours from the time you booked to complete identity verification, otherwise the reservation will be automatically canceled."

You’ll be charged or refunded, if necessary, and this will also be shown before you confirm the change.

If the Host declines your request, or doesn’t respond, your reservation will stay the same.
Here are a few other things to keep in mind when making a change request:

You can’t make changes if your checkout date is in the past
Once changes have been made, any later changes must go through the process outlined above as a new request
If the Host altered their pricing for the new dates before you requested the change, your new reservation will reflect this pricing, unless you booked a special offer
Changing the reservation dates may affect if you're still eligible for a weekly or monthly discounted rate
Once a reservation has started, you can’t change the number of guests
If you do need to add more guests to your reservation, use the resolution center to process any additional payments you and the Host have agreed on

If you’re a guest, you can check your confirmation email for more details.

If an issue comes up that you’re not able to resolve with your Host (or your Host declines or doesn’t respond to your refund request), let us know and someone from our team will step in to help.

If we find the issue is protected by AirCover, we’ll get you a full or partial refund, or depending on the circumstances, find you a similar or better place to stay.

Remember that you have 72 hours to report any issue to us from the time of discovery."

adventure_level,"These definitions were created in partnership with the Adventure Travel Trade Association (ATTA):

Light: Guests should be comfortable sitting, standing, or walking for extended periods of time. Activities may include things like easy hikes, walking tours, wildlife tours, and cooking or art classes. Any activities which are more strenuous are optional.
Moderate: Guests should be comfortable participating in multiple hours of physical activity (3+ hours). Activities may include things like longer hikes, biking, kayaking, snorkeling, and horse or camel rides.
Strenuous: Guests should be comfortable participating in highly physical activities that may last the entire day (6+ hours), and past experience with the included activities is recommended. Full-day activities may include things like long hikes, bike rides, and kayaking. Adventures may also include higher altitudes, steep ascents/descents, strong currents, and rougher terrain or water.
Extreme: These Adventures are the most physically demanding, so prior experience or related training is strongly advised. Activities are highly challenging and may last the entire day (8+ hours). All-day activities may include things like strenuous hiking, biking over uneven terrain, and intense rock climbing. Adventures may also include higher altitudes, steep ascents/descents, strong currents, and rougher terrain or water."
EA_tips,"What to bring with you to the experience
Here are some materials to consider using for every kind of physical activity.

Water or electrolyte sports beverages
First aid kit
Ice packs
Blood/heart pressure monitor
Your country’s first aid app
Your country’s hazards app
Before the activity
Here are some recommendations before you participate in physical activities:

Sleep properly (6–8 hours) the night before the activity
Avoid drinking alcohol or taking any substance that might affect your heart rate and awareness
Have a substantial and healthy meal before the activity (ex: fruits, protein, and carbohydrates) and avoid food with grease and spices that might irritate the stomach
Ask the host of the experience what the level of difficulty of the activity is in terms of time, distance, altitude, and effort—be conscious of your age and physical condition before you sign up for an activity
Check the forecast and use appropriate clothing and shoes
Identify the closest medical center in case of an emergency
Tips for during the activity
During the activity it’s important to check your health condition. Here are some suggested tips:

Before starting a physical activity, warm up and stretch the body for at least 10 minutes
Check blood pressure and breathing frequency minutes before
Have a good amount of water or electrolyte sports beverages within your reach—it is not recommended to drink liquids all the time, only when you feel thirsty
Use sunblock, wear a hat, and protect yourself from the sun by standing under shaded areas when possible
Write down an emergency contact number—having a simple emergency card with you will ensure time to reach a family member or friend (sometimes accessing emergency contact numbers on mobile phones takes more time)
Be aware of the surroundings and keep your belongings close
In outdoor activities share your location through mobile apps, devices, or GPS transmitters—in some areas, the mobile network could be inefficient, so we recommend sharing your location with your host as well as a relative or friend who is not attending the activity
Tips for after the activity
After physical activity, the human body needs a cool down phase. Here are some tips for recovery:

Drink water or electrolyte sports beverages until you feel satisfied
Eat healthy food that provides energy such as fruits, nuts, almonds, and protein bars
Pain in any part of the body could be a sore muscle—if the pain persists, it is recommended to check with a doctor
Headaches could be a sign of dehydration, which means it is important to drink water or an electrolyte sports beverage"
EA_evac,"Support offered by International SOS
International SOS will help support medically necessary evacuations for experience and adventures guests and will provide expert recommendations regarding health care globally to ensure guests have access to the most appropriate medical care. Where medically necessary, International SOS will make recommendations for and manage the end-to-end process of medical evacuations.

International SOS and emergency services
International SOS is not designed to be a replacement for local emergency services. If there is any doubt, local emergency services should be contacted prior to contacting International SOS.

Emergency planning
We recommend that all guests and hosts engaging in an experience prepare an emergency plan in case of a natural disaster or any other kind of emergency that could occur during an experience. Find out more about making an emergency plan."
experience_marine,"For Airbnb Experiences and Adventures that include animals, Airbnb has partnered with World Animal Protection to provide guidelines and articles that seek to promote the safety of wild animals in the wild and in captivity, as well as domesticated animals under human care.

Below are some best practices to follow in order to protect marine life when participating in ocean activities like diving and snorkeling: 

Don’t approach or intentionally touch the animals. Responsible tour operators will remind guests not to feed or pet curious aquatic life. You’re in their space, and they are wild animals, so they should be the ones to come up to you. Marine animals like turtles and whales can get stressed when people, especially in large groups, get too close. Wild animals who are being chased or feel threatened can bite or hurt themselves trying to escape. Give them space, and if they chose to come up to you, stay calm.
Don’t lure animals. While feeding animals may seem tempting as a way for them to get closer to you, animals should be left to find food themselves so they can continue their natural behaviors and don't become dependent on humans for food. By feeding fish or other marine life, you can also cause them to become sick.
Don’t take animals out of the ocean. Animals like starfish are not souvenirs. Whether alive or dead, these animals provide food for other organisms, and removing them can also allow invasive species to thrive.
In general, stay clear of coral reefs. It can take years for reefs that are unintentionally damaged to repair themselves. These coral reefs are home to marine life that depend on them for food and shelter. Don't take any part of the reef off the structure and out of the ocean, and if using sunscreen, wait 30 minutes after putting it on to ensure it’s been absorbed by the skin. Sunscreen is one of the biggest killers of coral reefs by bleaching the coral, and it can also be toxic to animals that call the reef home. Protect yourself with reef-safe and animal-safe sunscreen.

Conduct that violates our guidelines
If you come across an Airbnb Experience that violates the Animal Welfare Guidelines, threatens the safety of our hosts or guests, or risks the welfare and/or conservation of animals, please contact us. If applicable, make a note of the date, time and location, as well as the type of animals involved.

If we are made aware that an Airbnb Experience and/or host violates our platform policies, community standards, or terms of service, we take action including permanent removal from our community if warranted. We’re constantly reviewing and revising our platform policies and protections in order to make our community safer and higher quality."
experience_equine,"For Airbnb Experiences and Adventures that include animals, Airbnb has partnered with World Animal Protection to provide guidelines and articles that seek to promote the safety of wild animals in the wild and in captivity, as well as domesticated animals under human care.

Many cultures rely on working equines (like horses or donkeys) to get from one place to another, but it’s important to watch for animals who may be suffering. They should never be used for entertainment, including sporting events like horse racing, polo, or rodeos, or used for carriage rides in congested cities. While nature is best observed on foot, if you do ride horses or donkeys on an Airbnb Experience, be aware of signs of malnourishment and mistreatment.

When interacting with domestic animals, the “Five Freedoms” should be followed. They are:

Freedom from hunger or thirst with access to fresh water and an appropriate diet to maintain full health
Freedom from discomfort by providing an appropriate environment including shelter and a comfortable resting area
Freedom from pain, injury, or disease by treating animals respectfully and providing prompt access to veterinary care
Freedom to express normal behavior by providing sufficient space, proper facilities, and allowing for company of the animal’s own kind
Freedom from fear and distress by ensuring conditions and treatment which avoid mental suffering
If you witness or participate in activities with working equines, consider the following:

Working equines must be treated with consideration and given adequate shelter, exercise, veterinary care (including hoof care), and food and water appropriate to their physiological and behavioral needs. Horses and donkeys should not work more than 6 hours a day, and should have at least 2 non-working days each week.
A horse or donkey should not carry more than 20 percent of their body weight, with a maximum of 50 kg (110 pounds) for small donkeys and 100kg (220 pounds) for larger mature donkeys. Animals should never be ridden if they are pregnant, sick, or have open wounds and sores. Mares should not be worked for at least 3 months after giving birth.
Animals should not be worked in extreme weather conditions, including excessive heat or freezing temperatures, and should be alert to their surroundings. All working animals should have food and water readily accessible as well as adequate time to rest.

Conduct that violates our guidelines
If you come across an experience that violates the Animal Welfare Guidelines, threatens the safety of our hosts or guests, or risks the welfare and/or conservation of animals, or if you witness an animal suffering while taking an Airbnb Experience or Adventure, please contact us. If applicable, make a note of the date, time and location, as well as the type of animals involved in the experience.

If we are made aware that an experience and/or host violates our platform policies, community standards, or terms of service, we take action including permanent removal from our community if warranted. We’re constantly reviewing and revising our platform policies and protections in order to make our community safer and higher quality."
damages,"Accidents are rare, but they happen. If you, someone you invite, or a pet are responsible for damage during a stay, let your Host know right away.

The best way to do this is by sending them a message through the Airbnb website or app, just in case our Community Support team needs to refer to it later. If you can provide photos, that’s great, too.

Being upfront about damage gives your Host as much time as possible to fix it before their next guest arrives. It also gives you two a chance to find a resolution without Airbnb getting involved.

About the reimbursement process
1. Your Host may request reimbursement

If your Host believes that you’re responsible for damage, missing items, or unexpected cleaning costs, they may send you a reimbursement request through our Resolution Center. You’ll have 24 hours to respond.

If you pay the full amount, the request will be closed.
If you pay a partial amount, decline the request, or ignore the request, your Host may involve Airbnb as a next step.
2. Your Host may involve Airbnb

If your Host involves Airbnb, a member of our Community Support team will determine if you’re responsible for the damage and if the amount your Host is requesting is reasonable. They’ll do this by reviewing evidence provided by your Host, as well as any notes you included in your initial response to your Host’s request. Someone may also follow up with you or others who may have information about the Host’s damage claim.

3. Airbnb may ask you to pay

You’ll be given the opportunity to voluntarily submit a timely payment or an appeal. If you don’t submit a timely payment or appeal, or your appeal is unsuccessful, your payment method will be charged. (This does not apply to stays in China, Japan, or India.) You’ll never be charged without advance notice or a chance to appeal before and after you’ve been charged. You’ll have 60 days to appeal after you’ve been charged.

Dealing with damage is never fun, but this process is designed to be as fair as possible."
book_missing,"Hosts can choose to hide their listing at any time from search results, usually to prevent new bookings.

Before your reservation is confirmed, hosts are encouraged to confirm reservations quickly. But if you’ve sent a trip request and the listing is now hidden, you can contact the Host to find out if there’s a problem.

After confirmation, if you have a confirmed trip, it's still active, even if your Host has hidden the listing.

To find your itinerary, go to Trips and choose your trip under Upcoming. Then click or tap Show more trip plans.

You and your Host can also still message through Airbnb to confirm details about check-in, checkout, and any additional information."
experience_confirm,"When you book an Airbnb Experience, we'll send you a booking confirmation via email.

reserve_multiple,"If you have one reservation ending and another starting within 4 days, and the locations aren't far apart, we bundle them under a single trip.

For example, you might have two upcoming reservations—one in Tulum for May 1, and one in Playa del Carmen for May 3. Because they’re only an hour’s drive apart, both reservations will appear under the same trip in Trips."

Leaving also makes it harder for us to protect your information and puts you at greater risk of fraud and other security issues, such as phishing.

Pay your Host through Airbnb
If you paid via wire or bank transfer it may be a fraudulent reservation. To get help, let us know immediately. You can always check if your reservation was booked through Airbnb.

We protect you and the Airbnb community
We do our best to keep you safe by reviewing messages on the Airbnb platform. We’ll block potentially dangerous messages that contain words or numbers that might include contact information or references to other sites, including external links.

You can help. If you get a suspicious message, let us know by reporting it or flagging it in your inbox."
resolution_help,"Need to send or request money for things related to your Airbnb trip or Airbnb Experience? No problem! Go to the Resolution Center to open a refund or payment request.

You have up to 60 days after your reservation’s checkout date to submit a Resolution Center request.

One thing to note: You may need to add a payment method before sending or requesting money through the Resolution Center."
payment_plan,"Want to travel now and pay the rest later? Sounds good. 

What stays are eligible for payment plans 
You’ll find a payment plan option at checkout if your reservation meets the following criteria:

You’re paying with a credit card, debit card, PayPal, Apple Pay, Google Pay, or Airbnb credits.
You’re paying with a currency other than the Indian rupee (INR). Read more if you’re paying with the Brazilian real (BRL).
The reservation has a total value of $50 USD or more, including taxes and fees, and minus any credits or coupons.
The day your reservation starts is at least 14 days in the future (how far ahead you need to book is determined by the listing’s cancellation policy).
The reservation isn’t a long-term stay of 28 nights or more.
You’re not making an Airbnb for Work reservation.
Keeping track of payments
You’ll pay for part of your reservation once it’s confirmed, and future payments will be charged automatically on the dates listed at checkout.

Your email receipt will include information on upcoming payments. We’ll also send an email reminder 3 days prior to each charge, along with a link to manage your payment settings so you can edit your payment method or pay early if you like.

Cancellations
If you cancel, or the next payment can’t be completed by the due date, you’ll receive a refund according to your reservation’s cancellation policy.

Ex: Let’s say you cancel in time to receive a 50% refund, per the listing’s Strict cancellation policy. If only 50% of the reservation has been paid so far, no refund will be issued and the remaining 50% simply won’t be charged.

Coupons, credits, and gift cards
If you choose a payment plan during checkout, Airbnb credits, coupons, or gift cards will be applied first before the payment plan amount is calculated. Coupons, credits, or gift cards cannot be applied to the second payment, or any future payments.

Ex: Say you booked a trip for a total of $200 and you have $50 gift credits on your account:

During checkout, you’ll have the option to apply up to $50 in gift card credits
If you choose to apply the full $50 gift credits, you’ll have the option to pay $75 during checkout and $75 at a later date for the remaining $150 balance
You’ll also be required another form of payment as a backup—for example, a credit or debit card on file
When it’s time to automatically charge the second payment, the backup payment method you chose during checkout (for example, the credit or debit card you choose in addition to paying with credits or a coupon) will be charged $75 even if you have remaining or newly acquired Airbnb credits on your account."
payment_more,"Don’t worry: All pricing information is included when you book—but there are a few situations where you may owe more after paying:

You change your reservation (ex: You add another guest)
Your Host files an AirCover for Hosts request for damage that occurred during your Airbnb stay
Your Host requires taxes be paid at check-in—this should be clearly stated in the listing prior to booking
You booked a place, usually a hotel, that charges additional fees collected at check-in or within 48 hours of checkout—these must also be stated in the listing and your price breakdown prior to booking
When to dispute  
If a Host tries to charge you for something that wasn’t stated in the listing, the price breakdown, or their message thread, you can dispute it in the Resolution Center.

How to pay
If you agree with the charge, always pay the Host through the Resolution Center, never directly. Be sure to keep all payment transactions on Airbnb—otherwise, we can’t help with issues related to off-site or cash payments."
payment_declinedtrip,"If your trip request expires or is declined by the Host, there’s no cost for the reservation or Airbnb service fees.

Depending on your payment method, however, you may find a temporary authorization (a “hold”) or a refunded charge.

If your payment method is authorized
Some payment methods and locations require the full amount of the reservation to be authorized at the time of your request.

If it’s accepted, the authorization will become an actual charge to be deducted
If it’s declined or expires, the authorization will either disappear or appear as a refund—this may take up to 7 business days, depending on your bank
If your payment method is charged
Some payment methods or locations require the full amount of the reservation to be charged at the time of your trip request.

If it’s accepted, the charge remains, and your reservation is confirmed
If it’s declined or expires, you’ll be refunded automatically—this may take up to 10 days, depending on your bank"
payment_longterm,"Planning to stay awhile? Fantastic. Here's how payments work for reservations of 28 nights or more:

First-month down payment: You'll be charged this up front, but we’ll hold off on releasing it to the Host until 24 hours after check-in
Monthly installments: We'll charge your second payment to the same payment method approximately 1 month after check-in, and each month thereafter for the duration of your reservation
Your monthly price is locked in at the beginning of the reservation, and you can track your payment and find your total cost on your billing receipt."
cancel_longterm,The long-term cancellation policy?is automatically applied to all reservations of 28 nights or more and generally?requires a 30-day notice.
installment_early,"While it’s not required, you always have the option to pay upcoming monthly installments a little early, as long as it’s within 7 days before your payment is due.

For example, if your payment is due on July 11, you’ll be able to pay as early as July 4 at 12am UTC.

To find out when a payment is due:

Go to Trips and select the reservation you want
Click Show details
Under Reservation details, click Get receipts and manage payments
Go to Scheduled Payments and find the payment date"
payment_verify,"After you've finished adding Payment Methods, we may send you a message saying that you need to verify it by submitting a credit or debit card statement. Need a recent statement? Try downloading it through your card issuer's website or mobile app.
Your billing statement can be uploaded as a PDF or photo file. If you have a paper statement, take a photo of the first page that has your name and account information. If your statement is in digital form, take a screenshot, including the same information.

Block out account balances and transactions—we just need the last four digits of the account number to be visible.

We’ll email you within 24 hours after submission to let you know if you can use the credit or debit card on Airbnb."
tipping,"Acknowledgment for a job well done is always appreciated, whether it’s a good review or a tip. Guests often choose experiences because of in-depth reviews, so you would help the entire Airbnb community if you share your thoughts.

Additional fees:

Security deposit: Hosts who manage their listings with API-connected software can set a security deposit using our offline fees feature. Learn more about security deposits.

payment_currency,"Airbnb supports a number of different currencies to give you more flexibility when you host or stay with us. Choose to pay with your preferred currency when you enter your payment info, or change your default currency at any time. Depending on your payment method, some currencies may not be available.

Currency conversion
Airbnb displays prices in the currency you selected. If you change the currency at any point while booking, the price will automatically update in the new currency. When you’re ready to finalize your reservation, the checkout page will also show the new currency.

Third-party fees
If you choose to use a currency that doesn’t match your default payment method, your bank or credit card company may apply currency conversion fees to your payment. Airbnb isn’t responsible for these fees, so please contact your bank or credit card company to learn more.

Cross-border fees
When extra fees appear on your bank statement, or the amount charged differs from what was shown on the Airbnb checkout page, this might be why: If your bank or credit card company classifies Airbnb's processing entity as international, it may charge cross-border fees—even if the charge was processed in the standard currency of your payment method.

Airbnb doesn’t manage and can’t refund these fees, so please contact your bank or credit card company to learn more."
payment_paypal,"Depending on the currency you're paying with, PayPal may be available as a payment method. If PayPal is available, you'll be able to select it on the checkout page. If you don’t see PayPal as an option, you’ll need to either switch to an eligible currency or select a different payment method.

Once you select PayPal as your payment method, a new browser window will pop-up and you’ll be taken to the login screen on the PayPal site:

Log in to your PayPal Account
Choose one of your linked payment methods (ex: a credit card or bank account) under Choose a way to pay
Click Continue
Confirm the payment method, read PayPal’s policies, then click Agree & Continue
You’ll be taken back to Airbnb’s checkout page where you can confirm and pay for your Airbnb reservation.

Once the payment for the full amount of the reservation is authorized by PayPal, your reservation request will be sent (or your Instant Book reservation will be confirmed). You'll only be charged once your reservation is confirmed. If your reservation request is canceled, declined, or it expires, the PayPal authorization will be voided and you won't be charged.

You may need to link a bank account or credit card to your PayPal account to complete your Airbnb reservation. This alternate payment source will only be used if your primary method doesn’t go through. The PayPal website has more information about selecting a preferred payment method."

When you click Confirm booking, you’ll be redirected to a PayU payment page. On that page, you can choose to pay by using your India-based credit card, debit card, or bank account. Today, if you reside in India, PayU is the only available payment method.

When using PayU, you will be charged in Indian rupees (INR). Even if you are using a prepaid travel card based on foreign currency, also known as a forex card, your payment will still be charged in Indian rupees (INR).

You will be asked to go through a two-factor authentication to complete the payment.

When you request to book or book a reservation by using PayU, you’ll be charged in full at the time of the request or confirmation of reservation. When your payment is complete, the reservation request is sent to the host, who will have up to 24 hours to reply.

If your request is retracted, declined, or expires, your payment will be automatically refunded in full. Refunds can take up to 15 business days to reflect in your credit card, debit card, or bank account.

Contact your bank or card issuer
If you're getting an error when you try to pay, we recommend reaching out to your bank or credit card company for more information. Inform them of the amount and when tried to make the charge so they can let the transaction go through.

payment_chargeback,"When someone disputes a charge with their bank, a dispute process called a chargeback is initiated.

What’s a chargeback?
A chargeback is a formal payment dispute initiated by a consumer with their bank.

Chargebacks are usually filed by someone when they’ve noticed what they believe to be an unauthorized, incorrect, or unexpected charge on their account.

If you’ve filed a chargeback, you’ll need to contact your bank for more details on how their particular process works.

What happens once a chargeback has been filed and the dispute process begins?
Once a chargeback has been filed, it can take up to 90 days for the bank to resolve it. You can check the status of this process, or cancel it, by working with your bank.

While the chargeback process is ongoing, your bank may temporarily deposit the disputed amount into your account—it’s important to note that this amount comes directly from your bank, not Airbnb. If it’s determined that the charge from Airbnb was valid, then these funds may be taken back by the bank.

Will I still be refunded by Airbnb if I disputed a charge?
When a chargeback is filed, Airbnb is no longer able to resolve the dispute with you directly, and any refund you receive will come from your bank and not from Airbnb."
refund_find,"In most cases, your refund amount depends on your reservation’s cancellation policy and when you cancel.

You can find the refund amount and cancellation policy specific to your reservation by starting to cancel your stay or your Experience.

You can also learn about the cancellation policy for your reservation by going to Trips and selecting your trip, or by reviewing your reservation confirmation email.

You may be entitled to a full refund or one larger than the standard refund of your Host’s cancellation policy if:

You have to cancel because of an extenuating circumstance
You have to cancel because of a qualifying reason covered by the Airbnb Rebooking and Refund Policy
During your stay, you’re experiencing an issue covered by the Airbnb Rebooking and Refund Policy

f your plans changed due to COVID-19, check if the Extenuating Circumstances Policy applies to your reservation.

Refunds for canceled stays due to COVID-19 require proof of illness or exposure within 14 days of check-in. Ex:

Positive COVID-19 test
Doctor’s note
Notice from local government saying you've been exposed
Screenshot of notification from a contact tracing app
Positive test result from a member of your household"
refund_when,"Good news—if you’re eligible for a refund, you’ll get it automatically within 10 days. Maybe even sooner.

refund_request,"If you’d like to request a refund before or after your trip, refund requests of any amount can be handled through our Resolution Center.

We recommend discussing any refund amounts with your Host through your Airbnb message thread before submitting a request in the Resolution Center. However, if you and your Host aren’t able to come to an agreement, you'll have the option to ask Airbnb for help finding a solution. Issues must be reported to Airbnb with 72 hours of discovery to be eligible under our Rebooking and Refund Policy.

If you’re experiencing an issue during your stay, we’ll help you ask your Host to fix it, request a refund, or request to cancel for a full refund. It’s important to submit the request within 24 hours of noticing the travel issue. Your Host will have 1 hour to respond. If they decline or don’t respond, you can ask Airbnb to step in to help."
refund_eligible_travel,"Some travel issues need a little extra help. If you are experiencing any of these, you are most likely covered by the Rebooking and Refund Policy:

No access to the listing, for instance, if the Host provided the wrong lockbox code and now they can’t be reached
Space isn’t safe or clean upon arrival, such as dirty linens, or safety hazards
Key amenities are missing or not working, for example, that pool you were fantasizing about is in disrepair
Place isn’t as it was described in the listing description, maybe the number of rooms or beds is different, or accessibility features are missing

If you need to submit a claim, make sure to:

Gather evidence: Document issues with photos or videos
Contact us: Message or call Airbnb within 24 hours of having an issue
Stay in touch: We’ll reach out with next steps specific to you"

refund_cancellation,"You were all set to travel and now something’s come up. Find out how to cancel your stay or Experience. And please note that your refund is subject to the Host’s cancellation policy.

Your refund amount may also be affected by:

Cleaning fees: Always refunded if you cancel before check-in.
Airbnb service fees: Service fees are refunded if you cancel during the free cancellation period for your reservation. 
On-site property fees: If a hotel or other professional Host collects property fees on-site, any refund of those fees is at the discretion of the Host."
fee_airbnb_service,"To help Airbnb run smoothly and to cover the cost of services like 24/7 customer support, we charge a service fee when a booking is confirmed.

There are 2 different fee structures for stays: a split-fee and a Host-only fee.

1. Split-fee
This fee structure is the most common and is split between the Host and the guest.

Host fee
Most Hosts pay a 3% fee, but some pay more, including:

Airbnb Plus Hosts
Hosts with listings in Italy
Hosts with Super Strict cancellation policies
This fee is calculated from the booking subtotal (nightly rate + cleaning fee + additional guest fee, if applicable—excluding Airbnb fees and taxes) and is automatically deducted from the Host payout.

To review the service fee for a booking:
Go to Transaction history
Select the reservation code
Under Payout, find the Airbnb Service Fee
Guest fee
Most guest service fees are under 14.2% of the booking subtotal (nightly rate + cleaning fee + additional guest fee, if applicable—excluding Airbnb fees and taxes). This fee varies based on a variety of factors and is shown during checkout before you book so you know what to expect.

2. Host-only fee
With this structure, the entire fee is deducted from the Host payout. It’s typically 14–16%, though Airbnb Plus Hosts and Hosts with Super Strict cancellation policies may pay more. 

This fee is mandatory for traditional hospitality listings–such as hotels, serviced apartments, etc., as well as software-connected hosts (unless most of their listings are in the USA, Canada, the Bahamas, Mexico, Argentina, Taiwan, or Uruguay).

All Hosts with API connection will be enrolled to Host Only Fee and will not be able to opt-out.

VAT charges
Depending on the laws of the jurisdiction involved, a VAT may be charged on top of the above fees. The service fee includes the VAT where applicable.

We reserve the right to change our service fees at any time, and will provide you with prior notice of any fee changes before they become effective. Any fee changes will not affect bookings made prior to the effective date of the fee change."
pricing,"The total price of your Airbnb reservation is based on the nightly rate set by the Host, plus fees or costs determined by either the Host or Airbnb.

Types of fees
Airbnb service fee: Guest service fee charged by Airbnb—this provides 24/7 community support and helps everything run smoothly.

Cleaning fee: Charged by some Hosts to cover the cost of cleaning their space.

Extra guest fee: Charged by some Hosts for each additional guest beyond a set number.

Security deposit: Hosts who manage their listings with API-connected software can set a security deposit using our offline fees feature. Learn more about security deposits.

Value Added Tax (VAT, JCT, and GST): Charged to guests who live in certain countries—find out more about VAT.

Local taxes: Charged based on the location of the Host's place—find out more about local taxes.

Payment
You’ll be charged once a Host accepts your reservation request, or immediately if you use Instant Book. You may be able to split the total cost of your reservation across multiple payments if your reservation meets specific criteria, or you can pay the full amount in one go."
fee_service_refund,"If you need to cancel (It’s okay, things happen!), you may be able to receive a refund on your entire reservation, including the service fee. So how does it work? 

Most importantly: check your reservation’s cancellation policy to find out if the service fee is refundable. The service fee is refundable if you cancel before your reservation’s free cancellation period ends (or any time before check in, for reservations in Italy and South Korean travelers in some cases) or if the host decides to refund you in full after you cancel. 

Refunds for nightly rates and other fees
Your Host’s cancellation policy still applies to any other fees associated with your reservation. "
pricing_accurate,"Just as planning a trip in July differs greatly from one in February, so can the price. 

To see the most accurate price for your trip, add dates when searching for a place. Why? Because some Hosts have custom prices that override the default or minimum price for specific dates or time periods (including holidays, weekends, and week-long or month-long reservations).

If your Host updates the pricing for their place before you request the change, your new reservation will reflect this pricing."
pricing_cross,"Good news! You’re being offered a great deal. We only cross out a price when the one being offered is at least 10% lower than usual for a particular night. Who doesn’t love knowing they’re on to a good thing?

Types of discounts
Weekly or monthly discount: Hosts sometimes offer discounts on the nightly price for stays that are at least 7 days long.
Early bird discount: Hosts can offer a discount on the nightly price when guests book a certain number of days prior to their trip. For example, a Host might set a 15% discount for stays booked at least 2 months in advance.
Price drop: Hosts lower their price for specific dates that they choose.
How we calculate true discounts for price drops
We track all Host’s prices over time. By looking at the median price over the previous 30 days, we work out each Host’s average price. If a Host drops their price by 10% or more below the median for a particular date, we highlight the saving by crossing out the original price.

How it works
Let’s say you search for a night in June. We can see that over the last 30 days, the Host has changed the price for that night on 4 different occasions. We calculate the median price for this night by adding the middle 2 prices together, and dividing them by 2.

Price 1: $90
Price 2: $100
Price 3: $125
Price 4: $140

Median price: ($100 + $125) / 2 = $112.50

Next, we compare this median price to the current price of the night you searched for. If the current price is at least 10% less than the median ($112.50 in this example), we show you the median price crossed out, next to the discounted price.

Ex: $112.50 $100"
pricing_night,"If you submitted a trip change request to your Host and they accepted, your reservation will be updated to reflect the changes at your Host’s current daily rate. As with any hotel or B&B, your Host may have raised (or even lowered, if you’re lucky) the prices since you originally booked your reservation."
fee_cleaning,"Who doesn’t like arriving into a clean and tidy space? A cleaning fee is a one-off charge for cleaning the space you stay in and is set by the Host. It’s an extra amount on top of the nightly rate when you book a listing. This fee covers the extra expenses Hosts incur when getting their place ready for guests to arrive or after they leave. 

Things to know about cleaning fees
In the listing search results, you'll notice a nightly rate that includes the cleaning fee divided by the total number of nights of the trip. When you make a trip request, the nightly rate and the cleaning fee will be listed separately in the price breakdown.
The cleaning fee is part of the booking total and is not returned to guests at the end of the trip."

If you've enabled a Facebook or Google account but don't see any connections, it might be that your friends from that account aren't active yet on Airbnb. "

account_host_close,"We depend on our hosts to consistently meet our hospitality standards and rely on our guests to let us know when something isn’t as expected. That’s why we reviewed your ratings and reviews before deciding to close your account. In general, we decide to close an account if the host:

Has had their listings repeatedly suspended
Has overall ratings that are below 99% of all other ratings on Airbnb
Has violated of our Terms of Service

You can still host guests that are scheduled to arrive within 7 days of your host account being closed. For reservations scheduled past those 7 days, we’ll find another place for those guests to stay and cancel the reservations they made with you. If we cancel the reservation, you won’t be compensated for it.

Because we carefully looked at the reviews and ratings in your host account before we closed it, we do not frequently reverse this decision. However, if you feel that closing your account was a mistake, you can appeal it by using this form.

We'll consider your appeal only if:

You've received only positive guest feedback
There were extenuating circumstances
Your account has been inaccurately linked to a previously closed account
We won't accept appeals that claim:

The issue only happened once as we don't close host accounts based on a single negative review
The reviews were unfair—read more about Airbnb's Review Policy"
account_work_email,"Business travelers can use their regular Airbnb accounts to book business travel—all you need to do is link your work email address to your Airbnb account so we can confirm that you work for your company.

superhost_how,"If you’re a Superhost and want to share your experience with new Hosts, then you could become a Superhost Ambassador through the Ask a Superhost Program.

The benefits of being a Superhost Ambassador include:

Connecting with new Hosts and mentoring them as they bring their first Airbnb listing live
Rewards for each eligible new listing you help bring onto Airbnb 
Access to exclusive features, resources, and insights
To be eligible for the program, you must be a Superhost and your account must be in good standing. To apply to become an Ambassador, visit https://www.airbnb.com/ambassadors

Every three months, we check to make sure you continue to meet the following criteria so you can stay in the program:

You’ve maintained Superhost status
Your account is still in good standing
Superhost Ambassadors who don’t meet the quarterly criteria are welcome to apply to rejoin the program at a later date."
superhost_refer,"To refer potential Hosts, you can go to your Ambassador dashboard, copy your unique referral link, and share it through your preferred channels: messages, emails, social media, and more. Potential Hosts who use your referral link will land on a customized page with your name and profile picture, where they can create a new listing. Please remember that you’ll only receive an award if the new Host you refer follows your unique invitation link and creates a listing in the same session.

You can refer anyone who's new to hosting on Airbnb, even if they already have an Airbnb account. If a new Host previously received a referral invitation from someone else, or uses API-connected software, then you won't be eligible to receive a reward. (Rewards are also not available for referring potential Hosts who live in mainland China.)"
superhost_benefit,"The amount you earn from referring and mentoring new Hosts depends on a number of factors, including their listing location and type. As a result, you may receive a different payout for each qualifying referral or each Host you help through the Ask a Superhost program. If your new Host makes any changes to their listing location and/or type during the process, this may affect the way your payout amount is calculated. To view your anticipated cash award, visit your Ambassador Dashboard.

You get paid when a new Host you referred, or mentored through the Ask a Superhost program, completes their first qualifying reservation. The reservation must have a total value of at least $50 USD or the local equivalent (before taxes and fees) and must be completed no later than 200 days after you referred them. This doesn’t mean the nightly rate for the new listing has to be more than $50 USD, but it does mean the total value of the reservation (including all nights) must exceed $50 USD.

Qualifying reservations must be legitimate bookings—fake reservations, reservations made by family or friends, agreements to share referral awards, or other kick-back schemes all violate the rules of the program. The Host must also be new to hosting on the platform, which means that the property is being listed by that person for the first time and that they haven't listed any other properties on Airbnb before.

Payouts typically happen about 14 days after the guest checks out from the qualifying reservation. For example, if a qualifying reservation’s checkout date is January 10, the payment will typically be sent around January 24."
verify_identity,"Hosts may ask their guests to provide a government ID in order to book their place or experience. And sometimes we’ll ask for an ID to help us check that someone is who they say they are. Whatever the reason, your ID will never be shared with anyone else who uses Airbnb.

When you’re asked to confirm your identity, you’ll need to add either your legal name and address, or submit a photo of your government ID. This could be a driver’s license, passport, identity card, or visa. If you need to come back and finish confirming your identity later, that’s fine, you can pick up where you left off.

Sometimes, we’ll ask you to take a new photo of yourself. This is different from your profile photo, which you may also be asked to provide.

Please be aware that completing this process isn’t an endorsement of any Host or guest, a guarantee of someone’s identity, or an assurance that interacting with them will be safe. Always use your own best judgment, and follow our safety tips for?guests?and?Hosts.

In some cases, you may not need to add a government ID. We’ll confirm you’re really you when you add your legal name and address (this should match where you get banking documents or utility bills). We’ll match this information with secure third-party databases.

We never share your ID with anyone else who uses Airbnb. We do not provide Hosts with the photo of your ID, the photo you take of yourself as part of ID verification, or your address.

However, we do share:

The first name on your ID
Whether you’re over or under 25 years old
Whether your ID has been successfully added
Your profile photo and profile name"
ID_checked,"Your security a top priority. We want you to be confident that people on Airbnb are who they say they are. One way we do that is by checking for a government ID. This could be a driver’s license, passport, identity card, or visa.

Some Hosts require government ID in order for guests to book their stay or experience. Your ID will never be shared with anyone else who uses Airbnb."
ID_submit,"By providing your identification info, you help build trust in the Airbnb community.

When you’re asked to confirm your identity, you’ll need to add either your legal name and address, or a photo of a government ID (driver’s license, passport, or national identity card).?

If you need to come back and finish confirming your identity later, go to identity verification to continue where you left off.

Having trouble? Try these:
Check your messages:?You may have been sent additional information via text, email, or phone. Do you think you may have missed an email? Learn why.
Grant camera permission:?The Airbnb app or your browser may need permission to access your camera. Still not working? Try refreshing the app or page.
Use high-quality photos: Take photos in a well-lit room, checking that your face is clear and not obscured, and fit information within the provided white lines. Using “auto” mode will allow the app to automatically take high quality photos, although you can always switch back to take photos manually. Religious head coverings are welcome, but please make sure that we can see your eyes, nose, and mouth.
Submit photos of an original (not photocopied) and undamaged ID: If the ID has two sides, like a driver’s license or national ID card, submit photos of the front and back.
For residents of Singapore, Hong Kong, the Netherlands, Japan, and Korea: Be sure the image of your ID doesn’t show your identification or registration number. If you're uploading a Korean national ID card or driving license, please allow only the first 6 digits to remain visible (which contain your date of birth)."

stay_review,"Reviews are a great way for Hosts and guests to give each other feedback. They also help our community understand what to expect when making plans. Here’s how reviews work:

Once checkout is complete, we’ll ask you to write a review and provide star ratings for your recent trip or your guest
You have to submit your review within 14 days from the time of checkout—during that period, you may edit it until the other party submits their review
Reviews are only posted after a) both parties have completed theirs, or b) the 14-day period has ended—whichever comes first
You can also leave private feedback, which will only be shared with your Host or guest once the reviews are posted"

review_write,"Requirements:

1,000-word limit
Must follow our Review Policy
It’s important to note that you have to submit your review within 14 days from the time of checkout—after that, you can’t edit it.

The best reviews are helpful ones. Think about what you’d want to know before booking a stay or welcoming someone into your place. Highlight things like:

Your interactions with your guest, Host, and their associates—were they pleasant and respectful?
Anything that made the stay special, like cleanliness, personal touches, convenience, amazing coffee
Practical info: Was the Host helpful and available? Were you thrilled with the location? Was the listing accurate?
You’ll also have the option to leave private feedback, which will be shared when reviews are posted. Get more detail on how reviews work for stays.

If you want, you can leave private feedback to the Host or guest, which will be shared with just them when reviews are posted.

You can also leave a public response to a review that someone has left for you within 30 days of its posting. While you can’t remove their review, you can report it if you think it violates our Review Policy."

review_cancelled,"If the host cancels a stay before the day of check-in, you won’t have the option to leave a review. Instead, an automatic review will be added to their listing’s profile to indicate that they canceled the reservation. These reviews are one of the penalties for host cancellations and can’t be removed.

If the host cancels a stay on or after the day of check-in (12:00 AM in the listing’s timezone), you will have the option to leave a review. If you choose to leave a review, be sure to follow our Review Policy and only rate and comment on relevant experiences which you can personally speak to. For example, you may have valuable feedback about poor communication, an issue at check-in, or difficulty getting to a listing. However, if you didn’t complete check-in, you may not have relevant feedback about the location, amenities, or value."
review_host_notorder,"When someone browses your listing, reviews are ordered based on several factors that are relevant or helpful for guests, including things like:

How recent the review is
The language of the review
The country where the reviewer lives
The length of the review
For example, if a French traveler browses your listing, recent reviews written in French or by French guests will be shown first. This helps guests read reviews that are relevant to them so they can decide if your listing is a good fit.

However, even though a newer review might not show at the top of your listing page, all the reviews are still available for potential guests."

host_requirement,"To help create comfortable, reliable stays for guests, we ask all Hosts to meet these requirements for each of their listings:

Be responsive: Keep your response rate high by replying to inquiries and trip requests within 24 hours
Accept trip requests: Make guests feel welcome by accepting requests whenever you’re available
Avoid canceling on guests: Take cancellations seriously and try to avoid them—they’re a huge inconvenience
Maintain a high overall rating: Guests expect a consistent level of quality, no matter where they book

host_superhost,"You’ve got some great ideas for your first listing. But could you use some help? Ask a Superhost for guidance creating a listing, which can help you land your first booking.

Once you connect, the Superhost can:
View your public Host profile
Send you messages through Airbnb
Get updates on the status of your listing, like when you upload photos or publish it
Be notified when you receive your first booking

You can decide to give the Superhost edit access to your listing so they can make changes or fix problems. For example, they often adjust a listing’s location on the map so it shows up in the right place.

You’ll approve any changes before they’re shown to guests, and you can remove edit access at any time. And once your listing is published, the Superhost will no longer have edit access.

Once you receive your first booking, you’ll automatically disconnect from the Superhost—this means we’ll no longer show them information about your progress, but you’ll still be able to message each other.

To disconnect before your first booking, contact Community Support."
host_home_type,"Entire place
Guests will have the whole place to themselves, including a private entrance and no shared spaces.

Do make sure to note if you’ll be on the property (for example, “Host occupies first floor of the home"").
Private room
Guests will have their own private room for sleeping.
Other areas, such as a kitchen or living room, could be shared.
Do guests have their own bathroom? Note it in the description if they do—or don’t.
Shared room
Guests will be sleeping in a bedroom or a common area that could be shared with others.
It helps to note how many people they might be sharing with."
amenities_none,"While we don’t require hosts to provide essential amenities in their listing, we strongly encourage it.

host_longterm,"Enabling longer stays
Many guests at Airbnb book stays longer than one month. Review your availability settings to make sure guests can book longer stays:

Go to Listings and select a listing
Click or tap Availability
Go to Trip details and remove your maximum trip setting, or adjust it up and choose to manually review longer stays (if you don’t see this option, follow these instructions to turn on Instant Book)
Click or tap Save
Setting up weekly and monthly discounts
Most guests who are booking longer stays actively look for listings with weekly or monthly discounts. Weekly and monthly discounts are highlighted to guests in search results as well as on the price breakdown on your listing page.

To set a weekly or monthly discount for longer reservations:

Go to Listings and select a listing
Click or tap Pricing
Go to Discounts and enter your weekly or monthly discount
 Click or tap Save
Your weekly discount will apply to any reservation for 7-27 nights. Your monthly discount will apply to any reservation for 28 nights or longer.

Setting your discount amount 
When you set a weekly or monthly discount you’ll be able to get the average price for weekly and monthly stays, and find out if that matches the income you expect, with a single, longer booking.

You can also set your monthly discount to the same percentage as your expected vacancy. For instance:

If on average you book 24 days per month, you have an average 20% vacancy.
In that case, a 20% discount for monthly stays helps you earn a similar amount, with a single stay.
Optimizing your listing for longer stays
Besides enabling longer stays and setting up weekly and monthly discounts, here are some other ways you can make sure you are optimized to accept more stays.

Additional reservation preferences
Review the additional settings in Calendar Availability, including:

Advance notice: how soon can guests book
Preparation time: minimum time between bookings
Availability window: how far into the future can guests book.
Add a guidebook geared towards longer stays
Have a favorite spot to buy groceries in your neighborhood? Is there a great local gym or a dog park in your neighborhood? You can add those tips to your guidebook.

Add some improvements to your listing
Make sure you have the essential amenities for longer stays. Guests looking for longer stays typically look for listings that provide a well-equipped kitchen, laundry, stable and strong wifi, as well as the essentials required for any Airbnb listing.

Additionally, you should make sure that your House Manual includes the instructions for day-to-day living (such as how trash disposal works, any particular instructions for taking care of the space and plants, etc).

Be available and support your guests during a longer stay
During a longer stay the guest may require your assistance and reach out to you via the Airbnb app. You can provide detailed instructions for longer stays as a separate section of your House Rules

If you're sharing the space with your guest, you should also set expectations about your interactions. You can define this in the Guest interaction section of the Title & description settings of your listing."

If on average you book 24 days per month, you have an average 20% vacancy.
In that case, a 20% discount for monthly stays helps you earn a similar amount, with a single stay."

So, all Airbnb Plus Hosts are Superhosts, but not all Superhosts are Airbnb Plus Hosts.

Airbnb Plus Hosts provide outstanding service, demonstrating they genuinely care by:

Welcoming guests warmly and delighting them with details that show they’ve thought of everything
Being the epitome of kind, responsive, and committed to making things right"
airbnbplus_standard,"Each room feels tied together and features pieces that create visual interest, helping guests connect with their environment and get a sense for the host.

Spaces are clean and well cared for, offering everything a guest might need to make the most of their stay.

Memorable stays begin and end with genuine care and outstanding service with a personal touch. Airbnb Plus hosts bring their own unique spin on hospitality—welcoming guests with warmth, flexibility, and a commitment to making things right.

Once a listing is part of the Airbnb Plus program, it should continue to uphold the high bar set by the standards.

To help hosts know where they’re providing an outstanding experience and where there’s room to improve, we’ve updated the guest review questions to bring forward the feedback that matters most. We’re now asking guests questions after checkout that focus on the themes at the heart of today’s Airbnb Plus program: style, comfort, and hospitality. We’ve also removed the questions that you’ve told us offer you less value, such as the location accuracy of your listing.

There are two ways to learn what guests think about your place and hospitality:

Guest reviews: Along with your guest reviews, you’ll now find quick takeaways highlighting what stood out and what could be better, related to style, comfort, and hospitality. Go to your reviews to check out your takeaways.
Insights reports: We’ll email you regular insights reports letting you know how your guests rated the hospitality, style, and comfort of their stay.
Your listing’s Plus classification, privileges, and license to use the Plus classification may be revoked at any time at Airbnb’s sole discretion or if: you violate the?Plus Terms and Conditions, the?Airbnb Terms of Service, or any other Airbnb terms and conditions applicable to you; you or your listing no longer meet the program’s eligibility standards or qualifying criteria; or you or your listing are involved in incidents that violate Airbnb’s?hospitality standards."

Details: Share local tips, directions, and FYIs about construction, unavailable amenities, and other things that might impact a stay

Guest manual: Include any additional info guests might need, like the wifi password, where to find cleaning supplies, etc.

Welcoming details: Provide thoughtful niceties like fresh-cut flowers, bottled water, or local treats

Table settings: Ensure there are enough dishes, cups, and utensils to accommodate the maximum number of guests
Spotless upkeep: Wash towels, sheets, and bedspreads well, and consider updating linens every 4–6 months to keep things fresh"

If you offer your home at a lower rate, you will still receive your cleaning fee. Listings offered for free are exempt from cleaning fees.

The process is the same fas for regular Airbnb reservations. 
If you booked your stay using a grant, you can extend your stay up to the total value of the grant (you can find the value of your grant in the email invitation you received before booking).
You can’t add another payment method to a reservation. If you need to extend your stay but have reached the limit of your grant, you’ll need to book a new stay using a different payment method.

Airbnb may be able to waive any penalties if you have to cancel an Airbnb.org reservation because of an unexpected circumstance that’s out of your control. Find out more about the instances covered by Airbnb's Extenuating Circumstances policy.

If you’ve confirmed your circumstance meets the requirements, first cancel your reservation and then contact Airbnb to file a claim. Airbnb will walk you through the next steps, which will include submitting any required documentation and waiting for its team to review your case.

If you’re a host and your Airbnb.org guest cancels their reservation, we’ll notify you and automatically unblock the dates on your calendar so that you can host other guests. If your guest should have canceled but didn’t, cancel the reservation and reach out to our support team for help waiving the penalties.

host_payout_when,"Here’s the good news: Your money is coming! But when will you get it?

We’ll send your payout about 24 hours after a guest checks into your place.

If your guest is staying for 28+ nights, you’ll receive your payout monthly for their reservation.

If you have multiple listings with check-ins on the same day, funds will usually be deposited as a single payout. If you have a minimum payout amount set, your payout won’t be released until that amount is met.

As soon as Airbnb releases your payout, it’s sent for processing before it arrives with your payment provider. This means some additional time is usually needed for the money to finally settle in your account.

Alipay: Instant once Airbnb releases the payout (available for mainland China Hosts only)
PayPal:?Within 1 business day
Western Union: 1 business day, depending on country
Payoneer Prepaid Debit Card: 1-3 hours
International wire: 3-–7 business days
Bank transfer/ACH/direct deposit: Up to 7 business days

Banking systems don’t process transactions on weekends or holidays, so yours will be processed the next business day. Contact your bank directly if you have any questions."
host_payout_calculation,"Your nightly rate plus your optional extra charges (a cleaning fee or extra guest fee, etc.) minus the?Host service fee = your received payout.

This fee is calculated by multiplying the total booking amount by a percentage and then is automatically subtracted from your payout. Your guests do pay a?service fee?to Airbnb in addition to the cost of your listing. So your guest's total price is higher than your payout.

Here are some things that can impact your payout:

Calendar pricing: Weekend pricing or custom calendar pricing
Length-of-stay discounts: Your weekly or monthly discount
Long-term reservations: Payments are collected and released in monthly installments
Routing rules or minimum payout amounts: Changing your settings for routing rules or a minimum payout amount
VAT: Value-added tax (VAT) may be added in addition to the Airbnb service fee
Currency exchange: If your listing currency doesn’t match your payout currency, the exchange fee is deducted from your payout at the time of payment (to avoid this charge, simply change your currency in your listing’s pricing settings)
Adjustment fee: If you initiated a refund to your guest, or if you canceled a previous booking
Host coupon: If your guest used a host coupon you sent"
host_payout_longterm,"When guests settle in a long-term stay, you can look forward to reliable source of income for a while. For reservations like these, we collect and payments in monthly installments. 

We’ll charge your guest for the first month upfront and release that first payment to you 24 hours after their scheduled check-in time 
Future payments are released to you on a monthly basis, based on the check-in date, for the duration of the reservation 
You can check the status of your monthly payouts in your Transaction History. 

If you’re a new Host, we may hold your payouts for 30 days after your first reservation is confirmed. If your first reservation is more than 30 days away, your payout will be released 24 hours after your guest’s scheduled check-in. This will apply to any payouts scheduled for release during those 30 days. "
host_payout_cancel,"Sometimes things don’t go according to plan.

If your guest cancels (either before or during a trip), they’ll be automatically refunded according to your cancellation policy.

If your guest is owed a refund, that amount is deducted from your payout. To find your updated payout amount, go to your?transaction history.

If needed, you can give your guests an additional refund."
host_payout_cancelhost,"If you cancel a reservation before the trip starts, your guest will be refunded in full, and you won’t receive a payout for that booking.

If you cancel after the trip has started, we’ll deduct the refund amount from your next payout (or payouts until the full amount is collected). You'll see this reflected as adjustment on your transaction history.

Cancellations disrupt guests' plans and impact confidence in the Airbnb community. Because of this, certain host cancellation penalties will also apply."

host_payout_paypal,"To successfully use PayPal to receive host payouts, activate your PayPal account before adding it as an Airbnb payout method. Then, when adding your existing PayPal account to Airbnb, make sure that you correctly enter the email address associated with the PayPal account.

PayPal may require you to verify your account by providing additional identification or proof of address. If this requirement applies to you, any Airbnb payouts released during the PayPal verification time will be deposited into your account after it's verified by PayPal. During that time, Airbnb will notify you through email that there's an error.

When your newly added payout method is ready, PayPal allows you to receive Airbnb payouts directly to your PayPal account. After Airbnb releases your payout, PayPal typically delivers the funds to your account within 1 business day."
host_payout_payoneer,"When you sign up for Payoneer as a new customer with Airbnb, be sure that you enter the same address that you provided on the Airbnb payout method page. After signing up, Payoneer will approve your details or ask for additional information (like a copy of your government issued ID or Social Security card) by email within 2 days. When approved by Payoneer, a card will be mailed to you within 4-15 business days. You need to activate the card to receive funds. If you don't receive the card, please contact Payoneer customer service.

When your newly added payout method is ready, Payoneer allows you to receive payouts directly to a Payoneer Prepaid Debit MasterCard. Airbnb will load your payouts in USD or EUR, depending on your country, and you can view your balance on Payoneer's website. After Airbnb releases your payout, Payoneer typically delivers the funds to your account within 1-3 hours.

Payoneer applies fees for certain transactions and inquiries, including fees for transactions originating outside of the Payoneer country of issuance. Please visit Payoneer's Support Center for more information and guidance on fees that may apply to you."
host_payout_wire,"International wire transfer is available as an Airbnb payout method. To find out if it's available to you, check out your options when you add a payout method. If international wire transfer is listed for your selected country or region, you'll be able to connect your account as a payout method.

An international wire (or international wire transfer) is an electronic payment service for transferring funds. A wire transfer is considered international when Airbnb sends funds in a currency different from your local currency from a bank outside your country.

Your bank may charge a fee to receive a foreign currency. If the funds are transferred using an intermediate bank, the intermediate bank may also deduct fees from the payout. Airbnb can't inform you on how much you'll be charged to receive an international wire. In addition, Airbnb is not responsible for any fees deducted during the international wire, by your bank, or by the intermediary bank.

If you're a host and want to receive your payouts through international wire, please enter your local banking information in your payout preferences, even if your bank works with a specific intermediary bank. Airbnb's bank will take care of processing the international wire without the intermediary bank information.

According to Chinese laws, income from homes listed in mainland China may only be collected through a CNY (Chinese yuan) account located in China. You may choose to receive your payout using Alipay or your bank card, as long as it's issued by a bank located in China. If you don't set up a payout method with a CNY account in China, you won't be able to collect money for homes listed in mainland China."
host_payout_wu,"If Western Union is available and you choose it as your payout method, enter your name as it appears on your government ID, including your first, middle, and last names. Don't include special characters, apostrophes, or hyphens. To collect your payouts, your official ID will need to match your account information.

When your newly added payout method is ready, Airbnb will be able to send payouts to Western Union. After Airbnb releases your payout, the payout line will be updated in your transaction history and you'll receive a unique confirmation number (called an MTCN) in an email from Airbnb. You need this number to pick up your money from a Western Union Quick Cash agent location. Western Union payouts expire after 90 days.

Fees and conditions
Western Union processing fee: A $10 USD fee is deducted from each Western Union transaction to cover processing costs.
Minimum payout amount: A minimum payout of $60 USD is required before your payout will be sent. You may also choose to set an additional minimum payout amount that's higher than $60.
Maximum payout amount: The maximum Western Union transaction amount is $2000 USD. If your payout is more than $2000 USD, it’s divided into several smaller transactions. Western Union can’t process identical sums on the same day, so if you have a payout of $4000 or more, only $2000 can be processed per day.
Currency and exchange rate: Western Union payouts are sent in USD. Western Union sets any exchange rates between USD and your local currency.
Additional fees: Additional fees may be required by your local government. These are not set or charged by Airbnb."
host_payout_prepaid,"For security purposes, we do not allow prepaid debit cards to be used as a host payout method.

If a guest sends a financial contribution, you’ll receive 100% of this payment.

host_tax_how,"Local tax
If you determine that you need to collect tax, it's important that guests are informed of the exact tax amount prior to booking.

In some locations, Airbnb hosts may have a collect and remit feature available to handle occupancy tax. Hosts should not collect occupancy taxes separately for those jurisdictions.

If you’re a host who has provided your business tax ID and relevant tourist tax registration info, you may be eligible to collect taxes directly from guests by using our professional hosting tools.

If automatic occupancy tax collection and payment isn't available for your listing, you can collect occupancy taxes manually with a special offer or the Resolution Center.

Note: Transient occupancy tax payouts won't go through specific routing rules, and will only be sent to your default payout method.

VAT
If your country of residence is part of the European Union, Latin America, China, or South Korea, you may need to assess VAT on the services you provide. We encourage you to consult a tax advisor in your jurisdiction for more insight or if you need assistance assessing VAT on the services you provide.

Additionally, Airbnb is required to collect VAT on its service fees in countries that tax electronically supplied services. Currently, that includes all countries in the EU, Albania, Chile, Colombia, Iceland, Mexico, Norway, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Switzerland, and Uruguay. 

Airbnb is also required to collect VAT on its service fees from all users who contract with Airbnb China.

If we collect and remit taxes for your listing (default taxes)
If we already collect some taxes for you, there are two ways you can add taxes to your listing, depending on the jurisdiction your listing is in.

The first way lets you choose between default and custom tax collection. If you choose custom tax collection under this option, we'll only collect the taxes you add.

Go to your Listings page and click the listing that you want to edit
Select Local taxes and laws
Choose Custom tax collection
Click Add a tax
Select the Tax type from the drop-down menu
Select the Type of charge and then add the amount being collected in the box under Amount
Add your Business tax ID and Accommodations tax registration number (read additional info about tax IDs below) if applicable to your listing jurisdiction
Choose whether your region provides an exemption for long-term stays (if you choose Yes, you’ll be given the option to provide additional details)
Agree to the terms and click Save
If you later remove all custom taxes, you’ll automatically switch back to default tax collection.

The second way you may be able to add taxes to a listing is to add more taxes to the taxes we already collect. We’ll collect these taxes in addition to the taxes we automatically collect on your behalf. You can review the tax amounts collected by Airbnb.

Go to your Listings page and click the listing that you want to edit
Select Local taxes and laws
Click Add a tax
Select the Tax type from the drop-down menu

host_donate_airbnborg,"Anyone can give a one-time donation at any time to Airbnb.org to help people find emergency housing in times of crisis. Go to Airbnb.org and click Donate.

Airbnb users in most parts of the United States (except users in Arizona, Hawaii, and New Mexico) can donate directly through their Airbnb account. If you do not have an Airbnb account, or Airbnb does not yet support donations from your location, you will have the option of donating to Airbnb.org through PayPal.

For donors paying income tax in the United States, donations are tax-deductible to the extent allowable under United States tax law as a charitable contribution to Airbnb.org, an independent 501(c)(3) nonprofit. Donors should check their local tax regulations or seek professional tax advice to determine whether and to what extent their donation qualifies for any tax benefit.

You will receive a receipt after each donation to the email address associated with your Airbnb account or PayPal donation.

Donations are collected immediately once payment is made and are not refundable.

Donations to Airbnb.org are used to support emergency housing for people in times of crisis, like disaster evacuees, refugees, and relief workers providing long-term aid. Airbnb.org partners with nonprofit organizations to help distribute these funds and connect people with housing. These organizations are experts in their fields, and include CORE, Mercy Corps, and Church World Service.

Airbnb.org will provide periodic email updates on your impact, including an annual Impact Report. Find out more about who your donations could help at Airbnb.org.

Your donations support emergency housing for people in times of crisis. No fees are charged on the donation by Airbnb.org or Airbnb.

Other payments processors, including PayPal, may charge an additional processing fee."
host_payout_tax_deductible,"If you’re hosting a stay, it's possible that not all of your Airbnb income is taxable. Deductible items may include rent, mortgage, cleaning fees, rental commissions, insurance, and other expenses. Other factors you might consider when assessing taxable income include renting vs. owning the space, number of nights hosted, tax status, and total net amount earned (any tax forms issued to you display your total gross earnings).

We encourage you to consult a tax advisor for more details, as there are many special rules in this area and we aren't able to provide tax advice. One resource for an overview of your US income tax responsibilities and information on how to complete your US income tax return is Ernst and Young’s United States ""General guidance on the taxation of rental income"" (English).
