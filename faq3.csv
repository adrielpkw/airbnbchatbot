listing_type,What types of places are available to stay?,"Entire place
Entire places are best if you're seeking a home away from home. With an entire place, you'll have the whole space to yourself. This usually includes a bedroom, a bathroom, a kitchen, and a separate, dedicated entrance. Hosts should note in the description if they'll be on the property or not (ex: ""Host occupies first floor of the home""), and provide further details on the listing.

Private rooms
Private rooms are great when you prefer a little privacy, yet still value a local connection. When you book a private room, you'll have your own private room for sleeping and may share some spaces with others. You might need to walk through indoor spaces that another host or guest may occupy to get to your room.

Hotel rooms
Whether private or shared, hotel rooms provide a level of service and hospitality associated with traditional hotels. The rooms are available in boutique or lifestyle hotels, hostels, bed and breakfasts, or similar properties. They typically include vibrant common areas and rooms with unique touches.

Shared rooms
Shared rooms are for when you don't mind sharing a space with others. When you book a shared room, you'll be sleeping in a space that is shared with others and share the entire space with other people. Shared rooms are popular among flexible travelers looking for new friends and budget-friendly stays."
listing_type,What types of places are offered by Airbnb hosts?,"Entire place
Entire places are best if you're seeking a home away from home. With an entire place, you'll have the whole space to yourself. This usually includes a bedroom, a bathroom, a kitchen, and a separate, dedicated entrance. Hosts should note in the description if they'll be on the property or not (ex: ""Host occupies first floor of the home""), and provide further details on the listing.

Private rooms
Private rooms are great when you prefer a little privacy, yet still value a local connection. When you book a private room, you'll have your own private room for sleeping and may share some spaces with others. You might need to walk through indoor spaces that another host or guest may occupy to get to your room.

You’ll be taken to a page where you can choose a host. You’ll only be shown hosts from experiences or stays you’ve given four or five-star ratings. Hosts who are no longer hosting on Airbnb will not be shown.
Next, select a card design. To change the language of the card that your host will receive, tap or click the language selector. A check is shown next to the language in which the host will receive the card. The host's preferred language will also be indicated. Note that some card designs are only available in certain languages.
Then add a note to the host, if you like. To get ideas for what to say in your note, select ""Show some examples"" in the message box. Then, write your own note or edit one of the examples.
Finally, you'll have the option to include a financial contribution where 100% of your payment goes directly to the host.
You’ll be able to preview your card before sending it. Please note that your card and the message inside may be visible to others
After you send your card, you’ll receive a confirmation email including a copy of the card. If your payment method fails, you'll also receive an email letting you know you'll need to update your payment information in order for your contribution to be completed. Once you send a card to a host, you won't be able to send them an additional card.

You may not have the option to add a financial contribution to every card. Some hosts may not be able to accept financial contributions for various reasons, including living in locations where local regulations prevent them from accepting contributions. Also for group stays or experiences, only the guest who paid through Airbnb will be able to make a contribution to that host.

It’s your responsibility to determine whether your contribution is eligible for a tax deduction or credit."

EA_tips,How can guests of Airbnb Experiences prepare for physical activities?,"What to bring with you to the experience
Here are some materials to consider using for every kind of physical activity.

Water or electrolyte sports beverages
First aid kit
Ice packs
Blood/heart pressure monitor
Your country’s first aid app
Your country’s hazards app
Before the activity
Here are some recommendations before you participate in physical activities:

Sleep properly (6–8 hours) the night before the activity
Avoid drinking alcohol or taking any substance that might affect your heart rate and awareness
Have a substantial and healthy meal before the activity (ex: fruits, protein, and carbohydrates) and avoid food with grease and spices that might irritate the stomach
Ask the host of the experience what the level of difficulty of the activity is in terms of time, distance, altitude, and effort—be conscious of your age and physical condition before you sign up for an activity
Check the forecast and use appropriate clothing and shoes
Identify the closest medical center in case of an emergency
Tips for during the activity
During the activity it’s important to check your health condition. Here are some suggested tips:

Before starting a physical activity, warm up and stretch the body for at least 10 minutes
Check blood pressure and breathing frequency minutes before
Have a good amount of water or electrolyte sports beverages within your reach—it is not recommended to drink liquids all the time, only when you feel thirsty
Use sunblock, wear a hat, and protect yourself from the sun by standing under shaded areas when possible
Write down an emergency contact number—having a simple emergency card with you willensure time to reach a family member or friend (sometimes accessing emergency contact numbers on mobile phones takes more time)
Be aware of the surroundings and keep your belongings close
In outdoor activities share your location through mobile apps, devices, or GPS transmitters—in some areas, the mobile network could be inefficient, so we recommend sharing your location with your host as well as a relative or friend who is not attending the activity
Tips for after the activity
After physical activity, the human body needs a cool down phase. Here are some tips for recovery:

Drink water or electrolyte sports beverages until you feel satisfied
Eat healthy food that provides energy such as fruits, nuts, almonds, and protein bars
Pain in any part of the body could be a sore muscle—if the pain persists, it is recommended to check with a doctor
Headaches could be a sign of dehydration, which means it is important to drink water or an electrolyte sports beverage"

experience_marine,How can I protect marine life when diving and snorkeling on an Airbnb Experience?,"For Airbnb Experiences and Adventures that include animals, Airbnb has partnered with World Animal Protection to provide guidelines and articles that seek to promote the safety of wild animals in the wild and in captivity, as well as domesticated animals under human care.

Below are some best practices to follow in order to protect marine life when participating in ocean activities like diving and snorkeling: 

Don’t approach or intentionally touch the animals. Responsible tour operators will remind guests not to feed or pet curious aquatic life. You’re in their space, and they are wild animals, so they should be the ones to come up to you. Marine animals like turtles and whales can get stressed when people, especially in large groups, get too close. Wild animals who are being chased or feel threatened can bite or hurt themselves trying to escape. Give them space, and if they chose to come up to you, stay calm.
Don’t lure animals. While feeding animals may seem tempting as a way for them to get closer to you, animals should be left to find food themselves so they can continue their natural behaviors and don't become dependent on humans for food. By feeding fish or other marine life, you can also cause them to become sick.
Don’t take animals out of the ocean. Animals like starfish are not souvenirs. Whether alive or dead, these animals provide food for other organisms, and removing them can also allow invasive species to thrive.
In general, stay clear of coral reefs. It can take years for reefs that are unintentionally damaged to repair themselves. These coral reefs are home to marine life that depend on them for food and shelter. Don't take any part of the reef off the structure and out of the ocean, and if using sunscreen, wait 30 minutes after putting it on to ensure it’s been absorbed by the skin. Sunscreen is one of the biggest killers of coral reefs by bleaching the coral, and it can also be toxic to animals that call the reef home. Protect yourself with reef-safe and animal-safe sunscreen.

Conduct that violates our guidelines
If you come across an Airbnb Experience that violates the Animal Welfare Guidelines, threatens the safety of our hosts or guests, or risks the welfare and/or conservation of animals, please contact us. If applicable, make a note of the date, time and location, as well as the type of animals involved.

If we are made aware that an Airbnb Experience and/or host violates our platform policies, community standards, or terms of service, we take action including permanent removal from our community if warranted. We’re constantly reviewing and revising our platform policies and protections in order to make our community safer and higher quality."

While feeding animals may seem tempting as a way for them to get closer to you, animals should be left to find food themselves so they can continue their natural behaviors and don't become dependent on humans for food. By feeding fish or other marine life, you can also cause them to become sick.
Don’t take animals out of the ocean. Animals like starfish are not souvenirs. Whether alive or dead, these animals provide food for other organisms, and removing them can also allow invasive species to thrive.
In general, stay clear of coral reefs. It can take years for reefs that are unintentionally damaged to repair themselves. These coral reefs are home to marine life that depend on them for food and shelter. Don't take any part of the reef off the structure and out of the ocean, and if using sunscreen, wait 30 minutes after putting it on to ensure it’s been absorbed by the skin. Sunscreen is one of the biggest killers of coral reefs by bleaching the coral, and it can also be toxic to animals that call the reef home. Protect yourself with reef-safe and animal-safe sunscreen.

experience_marine,Protect marine life,"For Airbnb Experiences and Adventures that include animals, Airbnb has partnered with World Animal Protection to provide guidelines and articles that seek to promote the safety of wild animals in the wild and in captivity, as well as domesticated animals under human care.

Below are some best practices to follow in order to protect marine life when participating in ocean activities like diving and snorkeling: 

Don’t approach or intentionally touch the animals. Responsible tour operators will remind guests not to feed or pet curious aquatic life. You’re in their space, and they are wild animals, so they should be the ones to come up to you. Marine animals like turtles and whales can get stressed when people, especially in large groups, get too close.

experience_equine,How do I engage with equines on an Airbnb Experience?,"For Airbnb Experiences and Adventures that include animals, Airbnb has partnered with World Animal Protection to provide guidelines and articles that seek to promote the safety of wild animals in the wild and in captivity, as well as domesticated animals under human care.

Many cultures rely on working equines (like horses or donkeys) to get from one place to another, but it’s important to watch for animals who may be suffering. They should never be used for entertainment, including sporting events like horse racing, polo, or rodeos, or used for carriage rides in congested cities. While nature is best observed on foot, if you do ride horses or donkeys on an Airbnb Experience, be aware of signs of malnourishment and mistreatment.

When interacting with domestic animals, the “Five Freedoms” should be followed. They are:

Freedom from hunger or thirst with access to fresh water and an appropriate diet to maintain full health
Freedom from discomfort by providing an appropriate environment including shelter and a comfortable resting area
Freedom from pain, injury, or disease by treating animals respectfully and providing prompt access to veterinary care
Freedom to express normal behavior by providing sufficient space, proper facilities, and allowing for company of the animal’s own kind
Freedom from fear and distress by ensuring conditions and treatment which avoid mental suffering
If you witness or participate in activities with working equines, consider the following:

Working equines must be treated with consideration and given adequate shelter, exercise, veterinary care (including hoof care), and food and water appropriate to their physiological and behavioral needs. Horses and donkeys should not work more than 6 hours a day, and should have at least 2 non-working days each week.
A horse or donkey should not carry more than 20 percent of their body weight, with a maximum of 50 kg (110 pounds) for small donkeys and 100kg (220 pounds) for larger mature donkeys. Animals should never be ridden if they are pregnant, sick, or have open wounds and sores. Mares should not be worked for at least 3 months after giving birth.
Animals should not be worked in extreme weather conditions, including excessive heat or freezing temperatures, and should be alert to their surroundings. All working animals should have food and water readily accessible as well as adequate time to rest.

damages,Must I pay for damages if it is not done by me?,"Accidents are rare, but they happen. If you, someone you invite, or a pet are responsible for damage during a stay, let your Host know right away.

The best way to do this is by sending them a message through the Airbnb website or app, just in case our Community Support team needs to refer to it later. If you can provide photos, that’s great, too.

Being upfront about damage gives your Host as much time as possible to fix it before their next guest arrives. It also gives you two a chance to find a resolution without Airbnb getting involved.

About the reimbursement process
1. Your Host may request reimbursement

If your Host believes that you’re responsible for damage, missing items, or unexpected cleaning costs, they may send you a reimbursement request through our Resolution Center. You’ll have 24 hours to respond.

If you pay the full amount, the request will be closed.
If you pay a partial amount, decline the request, or ignore the request, your Host may involve Airbnb as a next step.
2. Your Host may involve Airbnb

If your Host involves Airbnb, a member of our Community Support team will determine if you’re responsible for the damage and if the amount your Host is requesting is reasonable. They’ll do this by reviewing evidence provided by your Host, as well as any notes you included in your initial response to your Host’s request. Someone may also follow up with you or others who may have information about the Host’s damage claim.

3. Airbnb may ask you to pay

You’ll be given the opportunity to voluntarily submit a timely payment or an appeal. If you don’t submit a timely payment or appeal, or your appeal is unsuccessful, your payment method will be charged. (This does not apply to stays in China, Japan, or India.) You’ll never be charged without advance notice or a chance to appeal before and after you’ve been charged. You’ll have 60 days to appeal after you’ve been charged.

If your Host involves Airbnb, a member of our Community Support team will determine if you’re responsible for the damage and if the amount your Host is requesting is reasonable. They’ll do this by reviewing evidence provided by your Host, as well as any notes you included in your initial response to your Host’s request. Someone may also follow up with you or others who may have information about the Host’s damage claim.

3. Airbnb may ask you to pay

You’ll be given the opportunity to voluntarily submit a timely payment or an appeal. If you don’t submit a timely payment or appeal, or your appeal is unsuccessful, your payment method will be charged. (This does not apply to stays in China, Japan, or India.) You’ll never be charged without advance notice or a chance to appeal before and after you’ve been charged. You’ll have 60 days to appeal after you’ve been charged.

Dealing with damage is never fun, but this process is designed to be as fair as possible."
book_missing,"I can’t find the place I booked on the site, what should I do?","Hosts can choose to hide their listing at any time from search results, usually to prevent new bookings.

Before your reservation is confirmed, hosts are encouraged to confirm reservations quickly. But if you’ve sent a trip request and the listing is now hidden, you can contact the Host to find out if there’s a problem.

What stays are eligible for payment plans 
You’ll find a payment plan option at checkout if your reservation meets the following criteria:

You’re paying with a credit card, debit card, PayPal, Apple Pay, Google Pay, or Airbnb credits.
You’re paying with a currency other than the Indian rupee (INR). Read more if you’re paying with the Brazilian real (BRL).
The reservation has a total value of $50 USD or more, including taxes and fees, and minus any credits or coupons.
The day your reservation starts is at least 14 days in the future (how far ahead you need to book is determined by the listing’s cancellation policy).
The reservation isn’t a long-term stay of 28 nights or more.
You’re not making an Airbnb for Work reservation.
Keeping track of payments
You’ll pay for part of your reservation once it’s confirmed, and future payments will be charged automatically on the dates listed at checkout.

Your email receipt will include information on upcoming payments. We’ll also send an email reminder 3 days prior to each charge, along with a link to manage your payment settings so you can edit your payment method or pay early if you like.

Cancellations
If you cancel, or the next payment can’t be completed by the due date, you’ll receive a refund according to your reservation’s cancellation policy.

Ex: Let’s say you cancel in time to receive a 50% refund, per the listing’s Strict cancellation policy. If only 50% of the reservation has been paid so far, no refund will be issued and the remaining 50% simply won’t be charged.

Coupons, credits, and gift cards
If you choose a payment plan during checkout, Airbnb credits, coupons, or gift cards will be applied first before the payment plan amount is calculated. Coupons, credits, or gift cards cannot be applied to the second payment, or any future payments.

Ex: Say you booked a trip for a total of $200 and you have $50 gift credits on your account:

During checkout, you’ll have the option to apply up to $50 in gift card credits
If you choose to apply the full $50 gift credits, you’ll have the option to pay $75 during checkout and $75 at a later date for the remaining $150 balance
You’ll also be required another form of payment as a backup—for example, a credit or debit card on file
When it’s time to automatically charge the second payment, the backup payment method you chose during checkout (for example, the credit or debit card you choose in addition to paying with credits or a coupon) will be charged $75 even if you have remaining or newly acquired Airbnb credits on your account."

You’ll pay for part of your reservation once it’s confirmed, and future payments will be charged automatically on the dates listed at checkout.

Your email receipt will include information on upcoming payments. We’ll also send an email reminder 3 days prior to each charge, along with a link to manage your payment settings so you can edit your payment method or pay early if you like.

Cancellations
If you cancel, or the next payment can’t be completed by the due date, you’ll receive a refund according to your reservation’s cancellation policy.

Ex: Let’s say you cancel in time to receive a 50% refund, per the listing’s Strict cancellation policy. If only 50% of the reservation has been paid so far, no refund will be issued and the remaining 50% simply won’t be charged.

Coupons, credits, and gift cards
If you choose a payment plan during checkout, Airbnb credits, coupons, or gift cards will be applied first before the payment plan amount is calculated. Coupons, credits, or gift cards cannot be applied to the second payment, or any future payments.

Ex: Say you booked a trip for a total of $200 and you have $50 gift credits on your account:

During checkout, you’ll have the option to apply up to $50 in gift card credits
If you choose to apply the full $50 gift credits, you’ll have the option to pay $75 during checkout and $75 at a later date for the remaining $150 balance
You’ll also be required another form of payment as a backup—for example, a credit or debit card on file
When it’s time to automatically charge the second payment, the backup payment method you chose during checkout (for example, the credit or debit card you choose in addition to paying with credits or a coupon) will be charged $75 even if you have remaining or newly acquired Airbnb credits on your account."
payment_more,What should I do if my host asks for more money?,"Don’t worry: All pricing information is included when you book—but there are a few situations where you may owe more after paying:

You change your reservation (ex: You add another guest)
Your Host files an AirCover for Hosts request for damage that occurred during your Airbnb stay
Your Host requires taxes be paid at check-in—this should be clearly stated in the listing prior to booking
You booked a place, usually a hotel, that charges additional fees collected at check-in or within 48 hours of checkout—these must also be stated in the listing and your price breakdown prior to booking
When to dispute  
If a Host tries to charge you for something that wasn’t stated in the listing, the price breakdown, or their message thread, you can dispute it in the Resolution Center.

How to pay
If you agree with the charge, always pay the Host through the Resolution Center, never directly. Be sure to keep all payment transactions on Airbnb—otherwise, we can’t help with issues related to off-site or cash payments."

When using PayU, you will be charged in Indian rupees (INR). Even if you are using a prepaid travel card based on foreign currency, also known as a forex card, your payment will still be charged in Indian rupees (INR).

You will be asked to go through a two-factor authentication to complete the payment.

When you request to book or book a reservation by using PayU, you’ll be charged in full at the time of the request or confirmation of reservation. When your payment is complete, the reservation request is sent to the host, who will have up to 24 hours to reply.

If your request is retracted, declined, or expires, your payment will be automatically refunded in full. Refunds can take up to 15 business days to reflect in your credit card, debit card, or bank account.

If you're based in India and you request to book or book a long-term reservation (LTR) for more than 28 nights by using PayU, you’ll be charged in full at the time of the request or confirmation of the reservation. When your payment is complete, the reservation request is sent to the host, who will have up to 24 hours to reply.

What’s a chargeback?
A chargeback is a formal payment dispute initiated by a consumer with their bank.

Chargebacks are usually filed by someone when they’ve noticed what they believe to be an unauthorized, incorrect, or unexpected charge on their account.

If you’ve filed a chargeback, you’ll need to contact your bank for more details on how their particular process works.

What happens once a chargeback has been filed and the dispute process begins?
Once a chargeback has been filed, it can take up to 90 days for the bank to resolve it. You can check the status of this process, or cancel it, by working with your bank.

While the chargeback process is ongoing, your bank may temporarily deposit the disputed amount into your account—it’s important to note that this amount comes directly from your bank, not Airbnb. If it’s determined that the charge from Airbnb was valid, then these funds may be taken back by the bank.

Will I still be refunded by Airbnb if I disputed a charge?
When a chargeback is filed, Airbnb is no longer able to resolve the dispute with you directly, and any refund you receive will come from your bank and not from Airbnb."

fee_airbnb_service,What is airbnb service fee for?,"To help Airbnb run smoothly and to cover the cost of services like 24/7 customer support, we charge a service fee when a booking is confirmed.

There are 2 different fee structures for stays: a split-fee and a Host-only fee.

1. Split-fee
This fee structure is the most common and is split between the Host and the guest.

Host fee
Most Hosts pay a 3% fee, but some pay more, including:

Airbnb Plus Hosts
Hosts with listings in Italy
Hosts with Super Strict cancellation policies
This fee is calculated from the booking subtotal (nightly rate + cleaning fee + additional guest fee, if applicable—excluding Airbnb fees and taxes) and is automatically deducted from the Host payout.

To review the service fee for a booking:
Go to Transaction history
Select the reservation code
Under Payout, find the Airbnb Service Fee
Guest fee
Most guest service fees are under 14.2% of the booking subtotal (nightly rate + cleaning fee + additional guest fee, if applicable—excluding Airbnb fees and taxes). This fee varies based on a variety of factors and is shown during checkout before you book so you know what to expect.

2. Host-only fee
With this structure, the entire fee is deducted from the Host payout. It’s typically 14–16%, though Airbnb Plus Hosts and Hosts with Super Strict cancellation policies may pay more. 

This fee is mandatory for traditional hospitality listings–such as hotels, serviced apartments, etc., as well as software-connected hosts (unless most of their listings are in the USA, Canada, the Bahamas, Mexico, Argentina, Taiwan, or Uruguay).

All Hosts with API connection will be enrolled to Host Only Fee and will not be able to opt-out.

VAT charges
Depending on the laws of the jurisdiction involved, a VAT may be charged on top of the above fees. The service fee includes the VAT where applicable.

pricing_cross,Why some prices are crossed out?,"Good news! You’re being offered a great deal. We only cross out a price when the one being offered is at least 10% lower than usual for a particular night. Who doesn’t love knowing they’re on to a good thing?

Types of discounts
Weekly or monthly discount: Hosts sometimes offer discounts on the nightly price for stays that are at least 7 days long.
Early bird discount: Hosts can offer a discount on the nightly price when guests book a certain number of days prior to their trip. For example, a Host might set a 15% discount for stays booked at least 2 months in advance.
Price drop: Hosts lower their price for specific dates that they choose.
How we calculate true discounts for price drops
We track all Host’s prices over time. By looking at the median price over the previous 30 days, we work out each Host’s average price. If a Host drops their price by 10% or more below the median for a particular date, we highlight the saving by crossing out the original price.

How it works
Let’s say you search for a night in June. We can see that over the last 30 days, the Host has changed the price for that night on 4 different occasions. We calculate the median price for this night by adding the middle 2 prices together, and dividing them by 2.

Price 1: $90
Price 2: $100
Price 3: $125
Price 4: $140

Median price: ($100 + $125) / 2 = $112.50

Next, we compare this median price to the current price of the night you searched for. If the current price is at least 10% less than the median ($112.50 in this example), we show you the median price crossed out, next to the discounted price.

Ex: $112.50 $100"

pricing_cross,I saw some prices getting crossed out.,"Good news! You’re being offered a great deal. We only cross out a price when the one being offered is at least 10% lower than usual for a particular night. Who doesn’t love knowing they’re on to a good thing?

Types of discounts
Weekly or monthly discount: Hosts sometimes offer discounts on the nightly price for stays that are at least 7 days long.
Early bird discount: Hosts can offer a discount on the nightly price when guests book a certain number of days prior to their trip. For example, a Host might set a 15% discount for stays booked at least 2 months in advance.
Price drop: Hosts lower their price for specific dates that they choose.
How we calculate true discounts for price drops
We track all Host’s prices over time. By looking at the median price over the previous 30 days, we work out each Host’s average price. If a Host drops their price by 10% or more below the median for a particular date, we highlight the saving by crossing out the original price.

How it works
Let’s say you search for a night in June. We can see that over the last 30 days, the Host has changed the price for that night on 4 different occasions. We calculate the median price for this night by adding the middle 2 prices together, and dividing them by 2.

Price 1: $90
Price 2: $100
Price 3: $125
Price 4: $140

Median price: ($100 + $125) / 2 = $112.50

If a coupon has expired, there’s no way to reactivate it.
Only one coupon can be used per reservation.
A coupon can only be used once. If you cancel a reservation that was booked using a coupon, the coupon is no longer valid.
For reservations of 28 nights or more, of if you choose a payment plan when you book, a coupon will reduce the total price and the amount will be split across payments.
Only coupons issued by Airbnb are accepted.
If you use less than the full amount of a coupon, any unused discount amount will be forfeited.
Coupons can't be applied to a reservation you made in the past.
Only the person who received a coupon can use it on Airbnb. There’s no way to transfer a coupon to someone else.
Coupons can only be used for the type of booking they were issued for. For example, if a coupon can only be used toward a stay, then it can't be used toward an experience, or for anything else on Airbnb.
If a reservation booked with a coupon is altered later on, you'll need to pay the difference with your payment method, or, if the alteration results in a refund, we'll credit your payment method for the difference. However, you won't receive a refund for the coupon amount, and the coupon won't be able to be used again.

verify_identity,Why am I required to verify my identity?,"Hosts may ask their guests to provide a government ID in order to book their place or experience. And sometimes we’ll ask for an ID to help us check that someone is who they say they are. Whatever the reason, your ID will never be shared with anyone else who uses Airbnb.

When you’re asked to confirm your identity, you’ll need to add either your legal name and address, or submit a photo of your government ID. This could be a driver’s license, passport, identity card, or visa. If you need to come back and finish confirming your identity later, that’s fine, you can pick up where you left off.

Sometimes, we’ll ask you to take a new photo of yourself. This is different from your profile photo, which you may also be asked to provide.

Please be aware that completing this process isn’t an endorsement of any Host or guest, a guarantee of someone’s identity, or an assurance that interacting with them will be safe. Always use your own best judgment, and follow our safety tips for?guests?and?Hosts.

In some cases, you may not need to add a government ID. We’ll confirm you’re really you when you add your legal name and address (this should match where you get banking documents or utility bills). We’ll match this information with secure third-party databases.

We never share your ID with anyone else who uses Airbnb. We do not provide Hosts with the photo of your ID, the photo you take of yourself as part of ID verification, or your address.

However, we do share:

The first name on your ID
Whether you’re over or under 25 years old
Whether your ID has been successfully added
Your profile photo and profile name"

real_fake_airbnb,Legit airbnb,"If you receive an email or are directed to a website that looks like Airbnb but asks for confidential information, be cautious. When in doubt, always start at the Airbnb home page. Type https://www.airbnb.com into your browser and go from there.

A real link to Airbnb will begin with https://www.airbnb.com or a country-specific URL like https://es.airbnb.com, https://it.airbnb.com, https://www.airbnb.com.at, or https://www.airbnb.co.uk. If you click a link that takes you to a page that looks like Airbnb but doesn’t start with this address, it’s a fraudulent page and you should close it.

Fraudulent emails often come from domains that may appear similar, such as @bnb.com or @reservation-airbnb.com. But legitimate emails from Airbnb will only come from the following domains:

@airbnb.com
@airbnbaction.com
@airbnblove.com
@airbnbmail.com
@support-email.airbnb.com
@supportmessaging.airbnb.com
@airbnb.zendesk.com
@e.airbnb.com
@express.medallia.com
@ext.airbnb.com
@guest.airbnb.com
@host.airbnb.com
@noreply@qemailserver.com
@outreach.airbnb.com
@research.airbnb.com
If it's not sent from one of these addresses, it’s not from Airbnb.
